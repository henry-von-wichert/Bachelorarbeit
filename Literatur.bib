The objective of this paper is to establish the state of the art on scientific and technologic locks, which have to be opened to consider direct atmospheric pressure plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (AP-PECVD) a viable option for industrial application. Basic scientific principles to understand and optimize an AP-PECVD process are summarized. Laboratory reactor configurations are reviewed. Reference points for the design and use of AP-PECVD reactors according to the desired thin film properties are given. Finally, solutions to avoid powder formation and to increase the thin film growth rate are discussed.},

	%abstract = {The coplanar microscale atmospheric pressure plasma jet (μ-APPJ) is a capacitively coupled radio frequency discharge (13.56 MHz, ∼15 W rf power) designed for optimized optical diagnostic access. It is operated in a homogeneous glow mode with a noble gas flow (1.4 slm He) containing a small admixture of molecular oxygen (∼0.5%). Ground state atomic oxygen densities in the effluent up to 2 × 1014 cm−3 are measured by two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TALIF) providing space resolved density maps. The quantitative calibration of the TALIF setup is performed by comparative measurements with xenon. A maximum of the atomic oxygen density is observed for 0.6% molecular oxygen admixture. Furthermore, an increase in the rf power up to about 15 W (depending on gas flow and mixture) leads to an increase in the effluent's atomic oxygen density, then reaching a constant level for higher powers.}

It is demonstrated that direct influence of the plasma, where charged particles contact bacteria directly, produces inactivation much faster than the indirect treatment, where plasma afterglow is delivered to the bacteria with a gas flow through the plasma region. This leads to an important conclusion that the effect of charged particles on plasma plays the essential role in interaction with living organisms, although synergy with longer living active molecules and atoms as well as UV radiation generated in plasma and at the surface of tissues may also play a role in inactivation.},

abstract = {Tetrapodal ZnO (T-ZnO) and aerographite networks represent two highly open porous (94.6 and 99.96\%, respectively) model materials on which the impact of an atmospheric-pressure plasma was studied for the first time. The air plasma treatment by a surface barrier discharge caused remarkable surface modifications on the T-ZnO template, leading to a large number of oxygen vacancies. These observations were made using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. In the second proposed set-up, pellets of aerographite material were processed to a plasma jet with pressurized air and nitrogen. Hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) was introduced as a precursor into the effluent jet for nanoparticle deposition. Opposing trends in atomic concentrations versus distance to the plasma source were observed when the gas (nitrogen or pressurized air) was changed. More pronounced nanoparticle coverage occurred in the pressurized air plasma. Their distribution was studied using SEM, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and Raman spectroscopy. Because of the higher oxidation in the pressurized air plasma treatment, the deposited nanostructures appeared to be a mixture of Si and SiOx nanoparticles.},

We show how the electric fields in the different electrostatic lenses present in the system can be optimized. These lenses direct the ions entering the system into the energy filter and the quadrupole mass filter. These lenses can exhibit chromatic aberration. The conditions without chromatic aberration have been found by simulating the ion trajectories in the part of the system up to the energy filter. Also, an experimental method is presented to find these settings. We show that the energy-dependent transmission of ions through the system is mainly determined by its acceptance angle. Ionenergy spectra from an argon plasma have been measured and corrected for the transmission of the ions through the system. Published by Elsevier Science B.V."

Secondly, one of the most interesting phenomena of APNP-Js, the ‘plasma bullet’, is discussed and its behavior described. Thirdly, the very recent developments on the behavior of plasma jets when launched in a controlled environment and pressure are also introduced.

The first method—UV-absorption spectroscopy in the Hartley band—determines space-resolved distribution of the ozone concentration in the jet effluent. The second method—quantum cascade laser-absorption spectroscopy in the mid-infrared spectral region—yields high sensitivity results of the average ozone concentration in a multipass cell, in which the effluent is directed. The results of both diagnostic techniques show excellent agreement.}

The homogeneous plasma with Tc of 1.8 eV and Tg of 2()0 °C. respectively, could decompose Ti(OR)4 to flush decomposition species onto a substrate placed in air. The film thus prepared was stoichiometric and amorphous TiO2, but contained short-range crystallinity. The phase structure of the films changed by the admixing of hydrogen in the plasma. The TiO2 film deposited from a TEOT H2 mixture had a high breakdown electric field (1.2 MV cm −1) as well as a high dielectric constant (ɛ= 54) even in amorphous phase."

%	abstract = {In most applications helium-based plasma jets operate in an open-air environment. The presence of humid air in the plasma jet will influence the plasma chemistry and can lead to the production of a broader range of reactive species. We explore the influence of humid air on the reactive species in radio frequency (rf)-driven atmospheric-pressure helium–oxygen mixture plasmas (He–O2, helium with 5000 ppm admixture of oxygen) for wide air impurity levels of 0–500 ppm with relative humidities of from 0% to 100% using a zero-dimensional, time-dependent global model. Comparisons are made with experimental measurements in an rf-driven micro-scale atmospheric pressure plasma jet and with one-dimensional semi-kinetic simulations of the same plasma jet. These suggest that the plausible air impurity level is not more than hundreds of ppm in such systems. The evolution of species concentration is described for reactive oxygen species, metastable species, radical species and positively and negatively charged ions (and their clusters). Effects of the air impurity containing water humidity on electronegativity and overall plasma reactivity are clarified with particular emphasis on reactive oxygen species.}

	journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
	abstract = {The density of helium He (23S1) metastable atoms is measured in a 1.6 mm diameter MHz-driven atmospheric pressure helium plasma jet by laser absorption spectroscopy with spatial and temporal resolution. The surrounding atmosphere of the jet is varied from pure oxygen to pure nitrogen with a gas shielding device. The highest metastable density of 1.3 × 1013 cm−3 is obtained in the center of the jet close to the nozzle exit at normal atmospheric air conditions. Within 0.3 mm in the radial direction and 2 mm in the axial direction, the He metastable density drops below the detection limit. The obtained He metastable lifetime is almost independent of the shielding gas composition. By analyzing the diffusion of shielding gas species into the effluent it is concluded that their density is too low to explain the observed He metastable lifetime. Instead, impurities from the feed gas, especially water molecules, are more likely to be responsible. However, a drastic change in metastable He density is observed when decreasing the amount of oxygen in the shielding gas. The lower the oxygen amount, the lower the metastable He density. For pure nitrogen, no He metastables are detected at all. By exchanging nitrogen with argon, a similar behavior is observed. Thus, it is concluded that it is the absence of ambient oxygen rather than the elevated presence of nitrogen, which is responsible for the observed decrease in the He (23S1) density.}

	abstract = {In this study, the effect of feed gas humidity on the reactive component generation of an atmospheric-pressure argon plasma jet and its effect on human skin cells are investigated. Feed gas humidity is identified as one key parameter that strongly influences stability and reproducibility of plasma medical studies. The plasma jet is investigated by absorption spectroscopy in the ultraviolet and infrared spectral region for its ozone production depending on the humidity concentration in the feed gas. By optical emission spectroscopy the dependence of present excited plasma species such as hydroxyl radicals, molecular nitrogen, argon and atomic oxygen on the feed gas humidity is investigated. As an interface layer between the plasma jet effluent and the biological cell, a buffer solution is treated and the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production is studied with two independent colorimetric assays as a function of humidity admixture to the feed gas. Ultimately, the effect of varying feed gas humidity on the cell viability of indirect plasma treated adherent HaCAT cells is investigated. The highest viability is found for the driest feed gas condition. Furthermore, this work shows answers for the relevance of unwanted—or intended—feed gas humidity in plasma medical experiments and their comparatively large relevance with respect to ambient humidity. The findings will lead to more reproducible experiments in the field of plasma medicine.}

%	abstract = {The formation of reactive species in the afterglow of a radio-frequency-driven atmospheric-pressure plasma in a fixed helium–oxygen feed gas mixture (He+0.5%O2) with humid air impurity (a few hundred ppm) is investigated by means of an extensive global plasma chemical kinetics model. As an original objective, we explore the effects of humid air impurity on the biologically relevant reactive species in an oxygen-dependent system. After a few milliseconds in the afterglow environment, the densities of atomic oxygen (O) decreases from 1015 to 1013 cm−3 and singlet delta molecular oxygen (O2(1D)) of the order of 1015 cm−3 decreases by a factor of two, while the ozone (O3) density increases from 1014 to 1015 cm−3. Electrons and oxygen ionic species, initially of the order of 1011 cm−3, recombine much faster on the time scale of some microseconds. The formation of atomic hydrogen (H), hydroxyl radical (OH), hydroperoxyl (HO2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitric oxide (NO) and nitric acid (HNO3) resulting from the humid air impurity as well as the influence on the afterglow chemistry is clarified with particular emphasis on the formation of dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS). The model suggests that the reactive species predominantly formed in the afterglow are major ROS O2(1D) and O3 (of the order of 1015 cm−3) and rather minor hydrogen- and nitrogen-based reactive species OH, H2O2, HNO3 and NO2/NO3, of which densities are comparable to the O-atom density (of the order of 1013 cm−3). Furthermore, the model quantitatively reproduces the experimental results of independent O and O3 density measurements.}

These plasmas create cocktails of ROS containing ozone, singlet oxygen, atomic oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxyl radicals, i.e. ROS of great significance as recognized by the free-radical biology community. By means of one-dimensional fluid simulations (61 species, 878 reactions), the key ROS and their generation and loss mechanisms are identified as a function of the oxygen and water content in the feed gas. Identification of the main chemical pathways can guide the optimization of He + O2 + H2O plasmas for the production of particular ROS. It is found that for a given oxygen concentration, the presence of water in the feed gas decreases the net production of oxygen-derived ROS, while for a given water concentration, the presence of oxygen enhances the net production of water-derived ROS. Although most ROS can be generated in a wide range of oxygen and water admixtures, the chemical pathways leading to their generation change significantly as a function of the feed gas composition. Therefore, care must be taken when selecting reduced chemical sets to study these plasmas.}

Relative cross sections sigma 1 and sigma 2 for single and double ionization have been determined in the respective energy ranges 14.1-2000 eV and 90-2000 eV which are wider than any previous measurements. These values have been normalized by reference to the absolute values of sigma 1 previously measured by Brook et al at energies (50-997 eV) where the possible influence of an unknown admixture of long-lived excited atoms in their experiment should be small. However at energies below about 25 eV our values of al become much smaller than the values of Brook at al. Above 40 eV, the present ratios sigma 2/ sigma 1 are in satisfactory agreement with other measurements which extend to 400 eV. Our values of al have been compared with selected theoretical predictions. Some evidence of structure in the energy dependence of sigma 1 in the region of the cross section maximum is consistent with predicted contributions from inner-shell 2s ionization and from autoionization in addition to outer 2p electron removal.}

C2H has marginal contribution to the growth due to its fast gas phase reaction with C2H2 resulting in a low C2H density.

	abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the closely related reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are often generated in applications of atmospheric pressure plasmas intended for biomedical purposes. These species are also central players in what is sometimes referred to as ‘redox’ or oxidation–reduction biology. Oxidation–reduction biochemistry is fundamental to all of aerobic biology. ROS and RNS are perhaps best known as disease-associated agents, implicated in diabetes, cancer, heart and lung disease, autoimmune disease and a host of other maladies including ageing and various infectious diseases. These species are also known to play active roles in the immune systems of both animals and plants and are key signalling molecules, among many other important roles. Indeed, the latest research has shown that ROS/RNS play a much more complex and nuanced role in health and ageing than previously thought. Some of the most potentially profound therapeutic roles played by ROS and RNS in various medical interventions have emerged only in the last several years. Recent research suggests that ROS/RNS are significant and perhaps even central actors in the actions of antimicrobial and anti-parasite drugs, cancer therapies, wound healing therapies and therapies involving the cardiovascular system. Understanding the ways ROS/RNS act in established therapies may help guide future efforts in exploiting novel plasma medical therapies. The importance of ROS and RNS to plant biology has been relatively little appreciated in the plasma biomedicine community, but these species are just as important in plants. It appears that there are opportunities for useful applications of plasmas in this area as well.}

	abstract = {Plasma medicine means the direct application of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) on or in the human body for therapeutic purposes. Further, the field interacts strongly with results gained for biological decontamination. Experimental research as well as first practical application is realized using two basic principles of CAP sources: dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) and atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJ). Originating from the fundamental insights that the biological effects of CAP are most probably caused by changes of the liquid environment of cells, and are dominated by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS), basic mechanisms of biological plasma activity are identified. It was demonstrated that there is no increased risk of cold plasma application and, above all, there are no indications for genotoxic effects. The most important biological effects of cold atmospheric pressure plasma were identified: (1) inactivation of a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multidrug resistant ones; (2) stimulation of cell proliferation and tissue regeneration with lower plasma treatment intensity (treatment time); (3) inactivation of cells by initialization of programmed cell death (apoptosis) with higher plasma treatment intensity (treatment time). In recent years, the main focus of clinical applications was in the field of wound healing and treatment of infective skin diseases. First CAP sources are CE-certified as medical devices now which is the main precondition to start the introduction of plasma medicine into clinical reality. Plasma application in dentistry and, above all, CAP use for cancer treatment are becoming more and more important research fields in plasma medicine. A further in-depth knowledge of control and adaptation of plasma parameters and plasma geometries is needed to obtain suitable and reliable plasma sources for the different therapeutic indications and to open up new fields of medical application.}

Today, a large body of information is available on the biomedical and clinical applications of plasma. Among the latter, wound healing is of special interest as there have been promising studies demonstrating a benefit of plasma in the treatment of chronic wounds. Wound healing is tightly regulated by redox mechanisms. This creates an exciting opportunity as we and others have identified reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to be the central components mediating biological effects of cold plasma. A directed delivery of the plasma-generated species to cells and tissues may therefore commence new therapeutic options not only in the healing of pathological wounds but also related to other redox-based diseases. The literature covers numerous findings on the biological effects of cold physical plasma sources. However, plasma sources strongly differ from each other making it challenging to summarize or even compare results from different types of sources from a physical and biological point of view. The aim of this comprehensive review is to provide a unique compendium of studies assessing the pre-clinical and clinical relevance as well as potential health risks related to the exposure to the atmospheric pressure argon plasma jet kINPen. This well-investigated and promising plasma source demonstrates a strong potential to be of clinical significance in the near future. Also, the collection of studies investigating its biological effects may serve as a role model for similar plasma sources and applications in the field of plasma medicine."

Apart from the basic plasma processes and the restrictions and requirements set by international health standards, the review focuses on plasma interaction with prokaryotic cells (bacteria), eukaryotic cells (mammalian cells), cell membranes, DNA etc. In so doing, some of the unfamiliar terminology—an unavoidable by-product of interdisciplinary research—is covered and explained. Plasma health care may provide a fast and efficient new path for effective hospital (and other public buildings) hygiene—helping to prevent and contain diseases that are continuously gaining ground as resistance of pathogens to antibiotics grows. The delivery of medically active ‘substances’ at the molecular or ionic level is another exciting topic of research through effects on cell walls (permeabilization), cell excitation (paracrine action) and the introduction of reactive species into cell cytoplasm. Electric fields, charging of surfaces, current flows etc can also affect tissue in a controlled way. The field is young and hopes are high. It is fitting to cover the beginnings in New Journal of Physics, since it is the physics (and non-equilibrium chemistry) of room temperature atmospheric pressure plasmas that have made this development of plasma health care possible.}

%	abstract = {Cold plasmas operating under atmospheric conditions have been in the focus of scientific attention not only due to their use in plasma medicine. Many of these plasma sources most notably produce ozone. This work presents a detailed ozone analysis on an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet operated in ambient air using ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy. A special focus is placed on the question whether other species are involved, or is the absorption signal due to ozone. For this, the wavelength dependence of the optical depth was measured and compared with the theoretical optical depth including the cross section of ozone. The results show that in the case of a MHz frequency driven atmospheric-pressure argon plasma jet the absorption signal in the UV range is solely due to ozone. Furthermore, this finding is verified by spectroscopic measurements in the IR spectral range. Additional space-resolved ozone density measurements are performed in the effluent of this jet with small oxygen admixtures by means of UV absorption spectroscopy. A funnel-shaped spatial ozone profile is found for all investigated oxygen admixtures. The highest ozone density develops on the effluent axis and in close vicinity to the jet nozzle. The maximal detected value is 1.5 × 1016 cm−3 for an oxygen admixture of 1%. In order to compare the results with non-space-resolved ozone detection methods the ozone net production rate is calculated.}

The reactive species output of the plasma jet is controlled using a shielding gas device. The shielding gas is varied using mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen at various humidity levels. Through the combination of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and zero dimensional kinetic modelling of the gas phase chemistry, insight into the underlying reaction mechanisms is gained. While the FTIR measurements yield absolute densities of ozone and nitrogen dioxide in the far field of the jet, the kinetic simulations give additional information on reaction pathways. The simulation is fitted to the experimentally obtained data, using the CFD simulations of the experimental setup to estimate the correct evaluation time for the kinetic simulation. It is shown that the ozone production of the plasma jet continuously rises with the oxygen content in the shielding gas, while it significantly drops as humidity is increased. The production of nitrogen dioxide reaches its maximum at about 30% oxygen content in the shielding gas. The underlying mechanisms are discussed based on the simulation results.}

	journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
	abstract = {Atmospheric pressure plasma jets for biomedical applications are often sustained in He with small amounts of, for example, O2 impurities and typically propagate into ambient air. The resulting poorly controlled generation of reactive species has motivated the use of gas shields to control the interaction of the plasma plume with the ambient gas. The use of different gases in the shield yields different behavior in the plasma plume. In this paper, we discuss results from experimental and computational investigations of He plasma jets having attaching and non-attaching gas shields. We found that negative ion formation in the He-air mixing region significantly affects the ionization wave dynamics and promotes the propagation of negative guided streamers through an electrostatic focusing mechanism. Results from standard and phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy ratios of emission from states of N2 and He imply different electric fields in the plasma plume depending on the composition of the shielding gas. These effects are attributed to the conductivity in the transition region between the plasma plume and the shield gas, and the immobile charge represented by negative ions. The lower conductivity in the attaching mixtures enables more extended penetration of the electric field whereas the negative ions aid in focusing the electrons towards the axis.}

	journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
	%abstract = {Absolute densities of metastable He(23S1) atoms were measured line-of-sight integrated along the discharge channel of a capacitively coupled radio-frequency driven atmospheric pressure plasma jet operated in technologically relevant helium–oxygen mixtures by tunable diode-laser absorption spectroscopy. The dependences of the He(23S1) density in the homogeneous-glow-like α-mode plasma with oxygen admixtures up to 1% were investigated. The results are compared with a one-dimensional numerical simulation, which includes a semi-kinetical treatment of the pronounced electron dynamics and the complex plasma chemistry (in total 20 species and 184 reactions). Very good agreement between measurement and simulation is found. The main formation mechanisms for metastable helium atoms are identified and analyzed, including their pronounced spatio-temporal dynamics. Penning ionization through helium metastables is found to be significant for plasma sustainment, while it is revealed that helium metastables are not an important energy carrying species into the jet effluent and therefore will not play a direct role in remote surface treatments.}

Moreover, the device is operating with a gas curtain of dry air. The absolute net production rates of the biologically active ozone () and nitrogen dioxide () species are measured in the far effluent by quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy in the mid-infrared. Additionally, a zero-dimensional semi-empirical reaction kinetics model is used to calculate the net production rates of these reactive molecules, which are compared to the experimental data. The latter model is applied throughout the entire plasma jet, starting already within the device itself. Very good qualitative and even quantitative agreement between the calculated and measured data is demonstrated. The numerical model thus yields very useful information about the chemical pathways of both the  and the  generation. It is shown that the production of these species can be manipulated by up to one order of magnitude by varying the amount of admixture or the admixture type, since this affects the electron kinetics significantly at these low concentration levels.}

	abstract = {This review summarizes the state of the art of plasma diagnostics on atmospheric pressure plasmas formed at characteristic length scales of approximately 1 mm or smaller and identifies challenges and prospects. Both plasmas generated in confined geometries, so-called microplasmas, as well as discharge filaments occurring in commonly filamentary plasmas, e.g. microdischarges in dielectric barrier discharges are covered. In spite of the differences between microplasmas which often obtain a quasi steady-state and single microdischarges or filaments which are self-limited in space and time and thus intrinsically transient, both face very similar diagnostic challenges of which two are immediately apparent: the high collisionality which requires adaptations of standard plasmas diagnostics often developed for low-pressure plasmas, and the requirements on high spatial resolution due to the strong gradients in plasma properties. The complexity of the plasma generation and the physical and chemical properties of the above-mentioned plasmas requires the knowledge of an extensive series of different parameters to obtain a full characterization. As the results of the diagnostics are not always unambiguous and require a detailed understanding of plasma physics and chemistry, a summary of the main properties and pecularities of high-pressure plasmas is included in this review.}

Research on atmospheric pressure non-equilibrium plasmas intensified over the last two decades leading to a large variety of plasma sources that have been developed for an extended application range including chemical conversion, medicine, chemical analysis and disinfection. The fundamental understanding of these discharges is emerging but there remain a lot of unexplained phenomena in these intrinsically complex plasmas. The properties of non-equilibrium plasmas at atmospheric pressure span over a huge range of electron densities as well as heavy particle and electron temperatures.

Many plasma sources of diverse design have been proposed for these applications, but the relationship between source characteristics and application performance is not well-understood, and indeed many sources are poorly characterized. This circumstance is an impediment to progress in application development. A reference source with well-understood and highly reproducible characteristics may be an important tool in this context. Researchers around the world should be able to compare the characteristics of their own sources and also their results with this device. In this paper, we describe such a reference source, developed from the simple and robust micro-scaled atmospheric pressure plasma jet (μ-APPJ) concept. This development occurred under the auspices of COST Action MP1101 ‘Biomedical Applications of Atmospheric Pressure Plasmas’. Gas contamination and power measurement are shown to be major causes of irreproducible results in earlier source designs. These problems are resolved in the reference source by refinement of the mechanical and electrical design and by specifying an operating protocol. These measures are shown to be absolutely necessary for reproducible operation. They include the integration of current and voltage probes into the jet. The usual combination of matching unit and power supply is replaced by an integrated LC power coupling circuit and a 5 W single frequency generator. The design specification and operating protocol for the reference source are being made freely available.}

Hence the origins and handling of such distortions are reviewed here. In the main body of this review, radical recombination and heat transfer at the external probe surface, acceleration into the probe orifice, chemical relaxation in the free jet, radial diffusion in the free jet, skimmer interference, Mach-number focusing, and fragmentation during detection are considered. A section on miscellaneous possible origins of distortions reviews briefly condensation, preferential scattering of beam molecules by background molecules, background invasion of the free jet, overun of slower molecules by faster molecules when sampling from an unsteady source, and contaminating the time-averaged signal for a given sampling location by the stored time-averaged signal for the prior sampling location. It is concluded that the increased understanding of MBMS sampling has provided the means for either avoiding or handling the possible distortions sufficiently so that MBMS sampling has graduated from an object of research and development to a tool for studies of complicated combustion systems."

	annote = {Atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) have been one of the most studied nonthermal discharges in the past decade. Recently, the use of multiple jets in order to cover larger areas has become desirable. However, the interaction between neighboring jets is a common phenomenon that can greatly modify plasma characteristics up to the point of merging several jets into a single one. The present study focus on bringing new insight on this phenomenon, named jet-to-jet coupling, investigating the discharge modes (coupled and uncoupled) of a plasma source composed of an array of seven plasma jets arranged adjacent to one another and driven by a sinusoidal excitation. The experimental results achieved by means of mass spectrometry, show a considerable increase in ion concentrations in the plasma, up to some orders of magnitude in the case of negative ions, as an effect of jet-to-jet coupling. Temporally resolved imaging of the discharge also shows how the evolution and intensity of the discharge are greatly affected by jet-to-jet interaction. Air/helium mole fraction and negative ions concentration are regarded as the main possible parameters affecting the coupling phenomenon. Moreover, experimental results suggest that the presence of remnant conductive channels behind the ionization fronts governs the propagation of the next ionization fronts, independently from the direction of propagation (from the source toward the target or vice versa). Furthermore, a parametrical investigation of the coupled mode discharge showed the presence of a critical value of the imposed voltage for which a drastic change in the electrical characteristics of the discharge is observed.}

	annote = {Ambient air species, which are transported into the active effluent of an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet result in highly reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). Especially for the envisaged application field of plasma medicine, these RONS are responsible for strong biological responses. In this work, the effect of ambient air transport into the effluent of an atmospheric-pressure plasma argon jet on the on-axis densities of nitrogen, oxygen and argon was investigated by means of absolutely calibrated molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS). According to biomedical experiments a (bottomless) Petri dish was installed in front of the MBMS. In the following, the near flow field is referring to the region close to the nozzle exit and the far flow field is referring to the region beyond that. The absolute on-axis densities were obtained by three different methods, for the near flow field with VUV-absorption technique, for the far flow field with the MBMS and the total flow field was calculated with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. The results of the ambient air particle densities of all independent methods were compared and showed an excellent agreement. Therefore the transport processes of ambient air species can be measured for the whole effluent of an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet. Additionally, with the validation of the simulation it is possible in future to calculate the ambient species transport for various gas fluxes in the same turbulent flow regime. Comparing the on-axis densities obtained with an ignited and with a non-ignited plasma jet shows that for the investigated parameters, the main influence on the ambient air species transport is due to the increased temperature in the case when the jet is switched on. Moreover, the presence of positive ions (e.g. 
) formed due to the interaction of plasma-produced particles and ambient air species, which are transported into the effluent, is shown.}

Results showed a significant difference in the dominant ion species between the two modes. In the Townsend mode, molecular oxygen ions, atomic oxygen anions and nitric oxide anions are the most abundant species, however, in the glow mode water clusters ions and hydrated nitric oxygen anions dominate. Several hypotheses are put forward to explain these differences, including low electron densities and energies in the Townsend mode, more efficient ionization of water molecules through penning ionization and charge exchange with other species in glow mode, and large temperature gradients due to the pulsed nature of the glow mode, leading to more favorable conditions for cluster formation.}

The atomic oxygen density, the ozone density and the depletion of molecular oxygen have been measured by MBMS and the atomic oxygen density has been validated by TALIF. Absolute atomic oxygen densities in the effluent up to 4.7×1015 cm-3 could be measured with a very good agreement between both diagnostics. In addition, ozone densities in the effluent up to 1.4×1015 cm-3 and an O2 depletion up to 10\% could be measured by MBMS. The atomic oxygen density shows a maximum value at an O2 admixture of 0.6\%, whereas the ozone density continues to increase toward higher O2 admixtures. With increasing distance from the jet, the atomic oxygen density decreases but is still detectable at a distance of 30 mm. The ozone density increases with distance, saturating at a distance of 40 mm. By applying higher powers to the μ-APPJ, the atomic oxygen density increases linearly whereas the ozone density exhibits a maximum.}

	abstract = {Microplasma jets are commonly used to treat samples in ambient air. The effect of admixing air into the effluent may severely affect the composition of the emerging species. Here, the effluent of a He/O2 microplasma jet has been analyzed in a helium and in an air atmosphere by molecular beam mass spectrometry. First, the composition of the effluent in air was recorded as a function of the distance to determine how fast air admixes into the effluent. Then, the spatial distribution of atomic oxygen and ozone in the effluent was recorded in ambient air and compared with measurements in a helium atmosphere. Additionally, a fluid model of the gas flow with reaction kinetics of reactive oxygen species in the effluent was constructed. In ambient air, the O density declines only slightly faster with distance compared with a helium atmosphere. In contrast, the O3 density in ambient air increases significantly faster with distance compared with a helium atmosphere. This unexpected behavior cannot be explained by simple recombination reactions of O atoms with O2 molecules. A reaction scheme involving the reaction of plasma-produced excited 
 species of unknown identity with ground state O2 molecules is proposed as a possible explanation for these observations.}

abstract = "A novel charged particle energy analyzer of simple geometry is described. Expressions for the potential distribution and electric field components defined by the geometry are given. A raytrace program using these components is discussed and results of its application are presented in graphical and tabular form. Also presented are experimental results for two versions of the analyzer in the form of representative spectra of well known species (Ar+, H2+, O2+). Finally, a comparison of the new instrument with the well known cylindrical mirror analyzer is outlined which suggests the superiority of the new instrument under the specific conditions given."

	annote = {Atmospheric pressure non-equilibrium plasmas (APPs) are effective source of radicals, metastables and a variety of ions and photons, ranging into the vacuum UV spectral region. A detailed study of these species is important to understand and tune desired effects during the interaction of APPs with solid or liquid materials in industrial or medical applications. In this contribution, the opportunities and challenges of mass spectrometry for detection of neutrals and ions from APPs, fundamental physical phenomena related to the sampling process and their impact on the measured densities of neutrals and fluxes of ions, will be discussed. It is shown that the measurement of stable neutrals and radicals requires a proper experimental design to reduce the beam-to-background ratio, to have little beam distortion during expansion into vacuum and to carefully set the electron energy in the ionizer to avoid radical formation through dissociative ionization. The measured ion composition depends sensitively on the degree of impurities present in the feed gas as well as on the setting of the ion optics used for extraction of ions from the expanding neutral-ion mixture. The determination of the ion energy is presented as a method to show that the analyzed ions are originating from the atmospheric pressure plasma.}

  abstract={Reactive plasmas are highly valued for their ability to produce large amounts of reactive radicals and of energetic ions bombarding surrounding surfaces. The non-equilibrium electron driven plasma chemistry is utilized in many applications such as anisotropic etching or deposition of thin films of high-quality materials with unique properties. However, the non-equilibrium character and the high power densities make plasmas very complex and hard to understand. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a very versatile diagnostic method, which has, therefore, a prominent role in the characterization of reactive plasmas. It can access almost all plasma generated species: stable gas-phase products, reactive radicals, positive and negative ions or even internally excited species such as metastables. It can provide absolute densities of neutral particles or energy distribution functions of energetic ions. In particular, plasmas with a rich chemistry, such as hydrocarbon plasmas, could not be understood without MS. This review focuses on quadrupole MS with an electron impact ionization ion source as the most common MS technique applied in plasma analysis. Necessary information for the understanding of this diagnostic and its application and for the proper design and calibration procedure of an MS diagnostic system for quantitative plasma analysis is provided. Important differences between measurements of neutral particles and energetic ions and between the analysis of low pressure and atmospheric pressure plasmas are described and discussed in detail. Moreover, MS-measured ion energy distribution functions in different discharges are discussed and the ability of MS to analyse these distribution functions with time resolution of several microseconds is presented.}

  abstract = {The surface of ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) rubber was treated in N 2 /Ar and N 2 /H 2 /Ar RF plasmas in order to achieve similar or better adhesion properties than NBR (acrylonitrile-butadiene) rubber, nowadays used as thermal protection of rocket chambers. The surface properties were studied by contact angle measurements and by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The treated surfaces of the EPDM samples show a significant reduction in the contact angle measurement, indicating an increase in the surface energy. XPS analyses show the incorporation of polar nitrogen- and oxygen-containing groups on the rubber surface. After plasma treatment the presence of oxygen is observed due to surface oxidation which occurs when the samples are exposed to the air. Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses indicate a decrease in the EPDM rubber surface roughness, promoted by surface etching during the plasma treatment. Strength tests indicate improvement of about 30\% and 110\% in the adhesion strength for the plasma treated EPDM/polyurethane liner interface and for the EPDM/epoxy adhesive interface, respectively. The adhesion strength of the EPDM/liner is similar to that obtained for the NBR/liner, which indicates that EPDM rubber can safely be used as thermal protection of the solid propellant rocket chamber.},

  abstract = {A non-thermal plasma source (`plasma needle') generated under atmospheric pressure by means of radio-frequency excitation has been characterized. Plasma appears as a small (sub-mm) glow at the tip of a metal pin. It operates in helium, argon, nitrogen and mixtures of He with air. Electrical measurements show that plasma needle operates at relatively low voltages (200�1�70 V peak-to-peak) and the power consumption ranges from tens of milliwatts to at most a few watts. Electron-excitation, vibrational and rotational temperatures have been determined using optical emission spectroscopy. Excitation and vibration temperatures are close to each other, in the range 0.2�1�73 eV, rotational gas temperature is at most a few hundred K. At lowest power input the source has the highest excitation temperature while the gas remains at room temperature. We have demonstrated the non-aggressive nature of the plasma: it can be applied on organic materials, also in watery environment, without causing thermal/electric damage to the surface. Plasma needle will be used in the study of plasma interactions with living cells and tissues. At later stages, this research aims at performing fine, high-precision plasma surgery, like removal of (cancer) cells or cleaning of dental cavities.},

Due to the numerous ways a plasma interacts with the polymer surface, the gas type and the plasma conditions must be adjusted on the polymer type to minimize degradation and aging effects. Wetting and friction properties of polymers can be improved by a simple plasma treatment, demonstrated on \{PC\} and EPDM, respectively. However, the deposition of ultra-thin layers by plasma enables the adjustment of wetting properties, using siloxane-based or fluorocarbon films, and further reduction of the friction coefficient, applying siloxane or a-C:H coatings. Nevertheless, the adhesion of plasma-deposited coatings should be regarded, which can be enhanced by depositing a graded layer. },

  abstract={Dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) are plasmas generated in configurations with an insulating (dielectric) material between the electrodes which is responsible for a self-pulsing operation. DBDs are a typical example of nonthermal atmospheric or normal pressure gas discharges. Initially used for the generation of ozone, they have opened up many other fields of application. Therefore DBDs are a relevant tool in current plasma technology as well as an object for fundamental studies. Another motivation for further research is the fact that so-called partial discharges in insulated high voltage systems are special types of DBDs. The breakdown processes, the formation of structures, and the role of surface processes are currently under investigation. This review is intended to give an update to the already existing literature on DBDs considering the research and development within the last two decades. The main principles and different modes of discharge generation are summarized. A collection of known as well as special electrode configurations and reactor designs will be presented. This shall demonstrate the different and broad possibilities, but also the similarities and common aspects of devices for different fields of applications explored within the last years. The main part is devoted to the progress on the investigation of different aspects of breakdown and plasma formation with the focus on single filaments or microdischarges. This includes a summary of the current knowledge on the electrical characterization of filamentary DBDs. In particular, the recent new insights on the elementary volume and surface memory mechanisms in these discharges will be discussed. An outlook for the forthcoming challenges on research and development will be given.}

	title = {Atomic nitrogen: a parameter study of a micro-scale atmospheric pressure plasma jet by means of molecular beam mass spectrometry},
	journal = {Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics},
%	abstract = {Absolute atomic nitrogen densities (N) in the effluent of a micro-scale atmospheric pressure plasma jet (µ-APPJ) operated in He with small admixtures of molecular nitrogen (N2) are measured by means of molecular beam mass spectrometry. Focusing on changes of the external plasma parameters, the dependency of the atomic nitrogen density on the admixture of molecular nitrogen to the plasma, the variation of applied electrode voltage and the variation of distance between the jet nozzle and the sampling orifice of the mass spectrometer are analysed. When varying the N2 admixture, a maximum density of atomic nitrogen of approximately 1.5  ×  1014 cm−3 (~6 ppm) is reached at about 0.25% N2 admixture. Moreover, the N density increases approximately linearly with the applied voltage. Both results are comparable to atomic oxygen (O) behaviour of the µ-APPJ operated at equal plasma conditions except for admixing molecular O2 instead of nitrogen (Ellerweg et al 2010 New J. Phys. 12 013021). The N density decreases continuously with increasing distance, but the decrease is slower than in the case of O atoms in He/O2 plasma. N atoms with a density of 2.0  ×  1013 cm−3 (~0.8 ppm) are still detected at 40 mm distance from the jet nozzle in controlled He/N2 atmosphere. The simple fluid simulation of N diffusion does not reproduce the measured densities of N. Nevertheless, a simulation taking into account atomic nitrogen reactions with gas impurities are able to reproduce the measured data, indicating that these reactions are an important loss mechanism of N atoms. The presented results are relevant for the future investigation of interactions of reactive nitrogen species with biological substrates.}
