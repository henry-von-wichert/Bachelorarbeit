Here, the role of reactive gas admixtures on the nanoparticle deposition rates is investigated for the case of reactive direct current magnetron sputtering of Ti in a gas aggregation chamber. The results show that, at low working gas (argon) pressures, stable cluster deposition at high rates can only be achieved for admixtures with a very narrow oxygen flow range. At higher pressures, stable deposition can be observed only after an intermediate maximum rate has been crossed or a stable deposition rate is not reached at all. For the different sputtering conditions, the partial pressure of oxygen was monitored with a mass spectrometer. The results are explained in terms of the competing roles of oxygen in cluster nucleation as well as in target poisoning. The cluster size distributions for different conditions were characterized by scanning electron microscopy.}

Plasma processes and conditions differ widely from one thruster to another, with the pre-eminence of magnetized, weakly collisional plasmas. Energy is imparted to the plasma via either energetic electron injection, biased electrodes or electromagnetic irradiation. Plasma acceleration can be electrothermal, electrostatic or electromagnetic. Plasma-wall interaction affects energy deposition and erosion of thruster elements, and thus is central for thruster efficiency and lifetime. Magnetic confinement and magnetic nozzles are present in several devices. Oscillations and turbulent transport are intrinsic to the performances of some thrusters.

The model is a good one if the Debye distance is small compared with the relevant scale length. As there is much current interest in radio-frequency (RF) discharges, the question arises as to whether the criterion remains valid in the presence of RF fields. The question has been studied recently by Riemann, following earlier work by Allen who compared the plasma boundary to a sonic surface. Riemann considered a wider range of frequencies and obtained a dispersion relation that was a quartic equation. The present paper examines the complex roots of this equation, using a method developed by Briggs. The results substantiate Riemann's statement that the Bohm criterion is still valid in the presence of RF fields.},

The much-used version of the Bohm criterion with the equality sign is obtained by employing the two-scale theory of the plasma and sheath, for the case where \$\textbackslash lambda\_D / L\$ -{$>$} 0.

Balance of forces acting on the ion fluid is delicate in the vicinity of the sonic point and weak effects come into play. For this reason, the passage of the ion fluid through the sonic point, which occurs in the transition layer, is governed not only by inertia and electrostatic force but also by space charge and ion-atom collisions and/or ionization. Occurrence of different scenarios of asymptotic matching in the plasma-sheath transition is analyzed by means of simple mathematical examples, asymptotic estimates, and numerical calculations. In the case of a collisionless sheath, the ion speed distribution plotted on the logarithmic scale reveals a plateau in the intermediate region between the sheath and the presheath. The value corresponding to this plateau has the meaning of speed with which ions leave the presheath and enter the sheath; the Bohm speed. The plateau is pronounced reasonably well provided that the ratio of the Debye length to the ion mean free path is of the order of \textsuperscript{-3\$} or smaller. There is no such plateau if the sheath is collisional and hence no sense in talking of a speed with which ions enter the sheath.},

  abstract = {The hollow-anode discharge is a special form of glow discharge. It is shown that a drastically reduced anode area is responsible for a positive anode voltage drop of 30-40 V and an increased anode sheath thickness. This leads to ignition of a relatively dense plasma in front of the anode hole. Langmuir probe measurements inside a specially designed hollow anode plasma source give an electron density and temperature of ne=109-1011 cm-3 and Te=1-3 eV, respectively (nitrogen, current 100 mA, flow rate 5-50 scc min-1). Driven by a pressure gradient, the 'anode' plasma is blown through the anode hole and forms a bright plasma jet streaming with supersonic velocity (Mach number 1.2). The plasma-stream can be used, for instance, in plasma-assisted deposition of thin films.}

The {$\gamma$}E for W is lower than the Cu cathode under identical operating conditions. The results show possible dependence of {$\gamma$}E on the Fermi energy of the cathode material since it influences the probability of electron to be emitted by the incident ion. In addition to this, we found, significant contribution of cathode directed species other than ion to {$\gamma$}E. Further, the effect of pressure on {$\gamma$}E for the N2 discharge has been investigated in the pressure range of 0.5 mbar to 2.0 mbar and its value increases from 0.38 to 0.47 with pressure for the SS304 cathode. The knowledge of {$\gamma$}E successfully explains the governing processes in abnormal glow discharge plasma that cannot be explained by the value of the ion induced secondary electron emission coefficient {$\gamma$}i.

The understanding of social influences will require the study of a wide range of conditions and of the interrelated operations of different psychological functions.

For certain purposes a large number of critical subjects was required for the present experiment. The present report is based on a total of 123 subjects.

This electrodeless ion source has been rebuilt incorporating several improvements and has been experimentally tested with different discharge diffusion lengths. The improvements include removing the rare earth magnets from the inside of the microwave cavity and embedding them in the cavity walls. The placement and strength of the magnets allows electron cyclotron resonant surfaces ( 875 G) to lie entirely within the discharge zone.

This paper reviews the substantial progress made in the design and application of ECR plasma technology in recent years. Five representative ECR reactor/source designs from large-area 450-cm2 discharges to compact plasma sources inserted into molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) machines are described in detail. The performance of these ECR devices is evaluated by computing performance figures of merit from the available experimental data. These calculations are then compared with the behavior as predicted from a global model of the discharge. This comparison suggests that global plasma models can be employed as an approximate method for ECR reactor design. More extensive diagnostics and numerical models that investigate the spatial variation of ion density and ion energy distributions are also presented. Several illustrative ECR plasma-processing applications are discussed. These include submicron etching of silicon, etching of III-V and II-VI electronic and photonic devices, and the epitaxial growth of GaN. The variety and the sophistication of these applications demonstrate that low-pressure high-density ECR plasma processing technology has evolved into a very useful, versatile group of plasma-processing machines},

  abstract = {In situ characterization of cosmic dust grains typically involves impactionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Considering the performance and limitations of previous instruments, I designed and tested a novel, compact time-offlight mass spectrometer for cosmic dust analysis. The instrument, Dustbuster, incorporates a large target area with a reflectron, simultaneously optimizing mass resolution, particle detection, and ion collection. Dust particles hit the 65-cm2 target plate and are partially ionized by the impact. The resulting ions, with broad energy and angular distributions, are accelerated through the modified reflectron, focusing ions spatially and temporally to produce high-resolution spectra. Initial performance tests of the Dustbuster used laser desorption ionization of embedded metal and mineral samples to simulate particle impacts. Mass resolution (mass/peakwidth) in these experiments ranged from 60 to 180, permitting resolution of isotopes. Subsequent experiments included hypervelocity microparticle impacts. Charged iron and copper microparticles, accelerated to 2-20 km/s in a 2 MV van de Graaff accelerator, impacted the Dustbuster. Mass resolution in these experiments ranged from 150 to 300 for iron and copper. Hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen ions appeared in many spectra. Field-induced emission of electrons immediately before impact is a possible cause of ion formation from species with high ionization potentials. The implications of this ionization effect are discussed in relation to interpretation of mass spectra from other in situ dust analyzers. Another time-of-flight instrument, originally designed as an energy analyzer, shows promise as a high-resolution mass spectrometer for high-flux cosmic dust environments. Ice is an important component of particulates ejected from comets and other icy bodies in the solar system. Due to limited experimental data on ice particle impacts, I built an ice particle source based on a vibrating orifice aerosol generator connected directly to vacuum. Ice particles produced in this manner can be electrostatically accelerated for impact ionization studies. Hypervelocity impact vaporization may have played a key role in the mass extinction that occurred at the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary. In order to study the speciation of gases that may have been produced in such an asteroid impact, I designed a specialized orthogonal extraction mass spectrometer for future laboratory impact experiments.},

For reasonable plasma and particle parameters, thrust and specific impulse over a broad range may be produced. The dependence of thrust on particle size, number of injected particles, and plasma temperature density allows for a better thruster precision. The scheme is shown to have modest power requirements.

  abstract = {The generalized Bohm criterion is revisited in the context of incorporating kinetic effects of the electron and ion distribution functions into the theory. The underlying assumptions and results of two different approaches are compared: the conventional 'kinetic Bohm criterion' and a fluid-moment hierarchy approach. The former is based on the asymptotic limit of an infinitely thin sheath (\textbackslash lambda\_D / l = 0), whereas the latter is based on a perturbative expansion of a sheath that is thin compared to the plasma (\textbackslash lambda\_D / l {$<<$} 1). Here lambda\_D is the Debye length, which characterizes the sheath length scale, and l is a measure of the plasma or presheath length scale. The consequences of these assumptions are discussed in terms of how they restrict the class of distribution functions to which the resulting criteria can be applied. Two examples are considered to provide concrete comparisons between the two approaches. The first is a Tonks\textendash Langmuir model including a warm ion source (Robertson 2009 Phys. Plasmas 16 103503). This highlights a substantial difference between the conventional kinetic theory, which predicts slow ions dominate at the sheath edge, and the fluid moment approach, which predicts slow ions have little influence. The second example considers planar electrostatic probes biased near the plasma potential using model equations and particle-in-cell simulations. This demonstrates a situation where electron kinetic effects alter the Bohm criterion, leading to a subsonic ion flow at the sheath edge.},

It is shown that the derivation of the conventional kinetic Bohm criterion is flawed. Low-velocity particles can cause unphysical divergences in the conventional theory. These divergent contributions are avoided with this new approach. The two theories are compared using example distribution functions from previous presheath models. The importance of ion-ion and electron-electron collisions to determining the particle distribution functions throughout the presheath is also discussed.

In the second experiment performed without the magnetic field closing the two ends of the device, the influence of the electrostatic boundary potential of the plasma is observed. Longitudinal ion velocity distribution functions have been recorded until inside the plasma sheath. The shapes of these distribution functions are in qualitative agreement with the results of a theoretical model and give an experimental justification for the "flux" shape of the ion velocity distribution source function retained in this model. However, to reach this qualitative agreement, it is necessary to adjust the ionic temperature for each distribution function suggesting that, for the authors' weakly ionized plasma, another heating mechanism is missing in this theory.}

Spraying site characteristics are determined as a function of propellant mass flowrate (in a novel way) and of propellant temperature. The dependence of mean specific charge on mass flowrate is found to be {$<$}q/m{$>$}?m-0?57, in excellent agreement with the findings of Pfeifer and Hendricks (1968).

It has been proposed for an approximate mathematical treatment, that the maximum impulse, transfered to an atom, moving parallel to the surface as a result of a single collision process, is a measure of the probability for the ejection of atoms out of the lattice. In accordance with the experiment the existence of an angle of incidence between 45\textdegree{} and 90\textdegree{} for the greatest sputtering yield can be shown. The samples have been investigated by light and electron microscopy. The furrows on the Cu-surface due to the bombardment with a monoenergetic, obliquely incident, parallel ion beam, show that the lattice ions have been ejected preferentially in the forward direction. An attempt is made to find a relation between the observed clods and furrows and the close-packed lattice planes.

Any quantitative use of the data requires a proper calibration, which is here performed for a miniaturized RFA. The calibration accounts for the transparencies of the RFA grids as well as for collisions inside the RFA. An analytical model is derived which covers both geometrical and collisional effects. The model is calibrated and experimentally verified using a Langmuir probe. We find that the transparency of an RFA is a random variable which depends on the individual alignment of the RFA grids. Collisions inside the RFA limit the ion current transfer through the RFA at higher pressures. A simple method is presented which allows one to remove these artefacts from the RFA data and to obtain quantitative ion velocity distributions.},

The discharge forced out from the hollow cathode forms a decaying plasma channel with extraordinary properties. Gas metastables excited inside the cathode can act in selected gas mixtures as a source of additional heat, thereby enhancing thermionic electron emission and ionization of the gas. An arc regime can be started from the glow discharge simply by increasing the r.f. power. Hollow cathode arc in the cathode metal vapor can be sustained even without working gas. Examples of utilization of hollow cathodes in the film deposition and dry etching technology are presented. Small size cylindrical r.f. cathodes allow special applications inside narrow ({$<$}10 mm in diameter) tubes.

Local electric fields can be determined from the behaviour of particles in the plasma, e.g. particles may serve as electrostatic probes. Since in many cases of applications in plasma technology it is of great interest to describe the electric field conditions in front of floating or biased surfaces, the confinement and behaviour of test particles is studied in front of floating walls inserted into a plasma as well as in front of additionally biased surfaces. For the latter case, the behaviour of particles in front of an adaptive electrode, which allows for an efficient confinement and manipulation of the grains, has been experimentally studied in terms of the dependence on the discharge parameters and on different bias conditions of the electrode. The effect of the partially biased surface (dc and rf) on the charged micro-particles has been investigated by particle falling experiments. In addition to the experiments, we also investigate the particle behaviour numerically by molecular dynamics, in combination with a fluid and particle-in-cell description of the plasma.}

A collisional-radiative model valid for the injected Li atoms is used to predict the emission intensities as function of n e and T\_e for several lines theoretically. In contrast to the electron temperature regime representative for the edge of tokamak discharges (T\_e {$>$} 5 eV), the ECR discharge offers a T\_e range where selected line intensity ratios strongly depend on the electron temperature. Therefore, a comparison of the measured ratios with the calculated ones yields T\_e profiles for the first time. The n\_e measurement is performed as in tokamaks by observing the attenuation of the beam due to ionization in the plasma. We present radial profiles of T\_e and n e for discharges in argon and xenon under different operating conditions. These results are compared with results obtained by Thomson scattering. Our measurements give evidence for a satisfying agreement between the two methods.},

The key topics are Langmuir probes (LPs), Faraday cups (FCs) and energy analyzers, mass spectrometry, as well as novel calorimetric and force probes (FPs). For each method, the concepts are introduced, hints at best practice are given, and a survey of the recently published literature is included. Starting with the sheath\textendash plasma boundary, the principles of plane and cylindrical LPs and the measurement of electron temperature and density are discussed. Beyond standard textbooks, double, triple and emissive probes are described and modulation techniques for obtaining the electron energy distribution function are presented. More technical issues related to probe compensation in radio-frequency plasmas, probe contamination, and the influence of a magnetic field are also included. The presentation is completed by modern radio-frequency techniques, such as impedance probes, multipole resonance probes, and self-excited electron resonance spectroscopy. FCs, retarding field analyzers (RFAs) as well as novel calorimetric and FPs are useful tools for the measurement of overall, not species resolved, ions and neutral species fluxes toward surfaces. RFAs provide overall ion energy distribution functions, whereas calorimetric and FPs can deliver information about fluxes of fast neutrals. The issues related to secondary electron emission, absolute signal calibration, and analysis of plasmas with complex chemistry are discussed. Mass spectrometry diagnostics is capable of mass and energy-resolved detection of ions and neutral species at the plasma-facing surfaces. Detection, identification and absolute density calibration of neutral stable and radical species are treated in detail and peculiarities of ion mass spectrometry, such as detection of negative ions, ion measurements in front of powered electrodes, or chromatic aberration and acceptance angle limitations in energy spectrum measurements are introduced.}

Die Energieverteilungen der Sekund\"arionen wurden f\"ur Al+-Ionen aus reinem Aluminium bei unterschiedlichen Prim\"arionenenergien zwischen 200 und 2000 eV gemessen. Die neutralen Al-Atome konnten nach einer nachtr\"aglichen Ionisierung durch Elektronensto\ss{} auf ihre Energieverteilung hin untersucht werden. Innerhalb der Fehlergrenze zeigte die Energieverteilung der Al-Atome aus einem Al-Target bei 800 eV Prim\"arionenenergie gleiches Verhalten wie der Al+-Ionen, die bei demselben Zerst\"aubungsvorgang entstanden. Die Energieverteilung der Al+-Ionen, aus einer Aluminiumlegierung (Duraluminium) zeigte bei gleicher Prim\"arionenergie gegen\"uber solchen aus einer reinen Aluminiumkathode eine starke Verschiebung zu kleinen Energien. Die Energieverteilung von Ionen, die von Verunreinigungen im Targetvolumen oder an der Oberfl\"ache stammen, wurde an sieben verschiedenen Ionenarten untersucht. Es zeigte sich, da\ss{} die Energie der Fremdionen immer wesentlich niedriger ist als die der Al+-Ionen avs der gleichen Kathode. F\"ur die Molek\"ulionen AlOH+ und H2O+ wurde ein prinzipiell gleiches Verhalten der Energieverteilung gefunden wie f\"ur die Atomionen Mg+, Na+, K+ and Ni+. Das bedeutet, da\ss{} die H2O+-Ionen aus der Adsorptionsschicht auf dem Target und nicht aus dem Volumen vor dem Target stammten. Gleiche Fremdionen aus unterschiedlichen Kathoden zeigen unterschiedliche Energieverteilungen. Die \"Anderung der Energie erfolgt dabei in demselben Sinne wie f\"ur die aus den entsprechenden Kathoden ausgel\"osten Al+-Ionen: Die Energien sind f\"ur Duraluminium niedriger als f\"ur reines Aluminium. Die beobachteten Unterschiede in den Energieverteilungen lassen sich verstehen, wenn man die Zerst\"aubung als Folge eines Impuls\"ubertragungsvorgangs innerhalb und an der Oberfl\"ache der Kathode betrachtet. Danach erfolgt eine \"Ubernahme des Impulses des einfallenden Ions in einer Reihe von St\"o\ss en durch die Gitteratome. Durch fokussierende St\"o\ss e gelangt ein Teil der Energie wieder an die Oberfl\"ache des Targets. Es wird gezeigt, da\ss{} ein Oberfl\"achenatom nur den Anteil \$E0 \textbackslash cdot F (F \textbackslash leq 1)\$ der Energie E0, die die Sto\ss folge an die Targetoberfl\"ache transportiert, \"ubernehmen kann. Ist das Oberfl\"achenatom ein Atom des Grundmaterials des Targets, dann gilt F = 1, handelt es sich um ein Fremdatom, dann gilt F {$<$} 1. Durch \$F = \textbackslash cos\^2 \textbackslash alpha \textbackslash cdot k\$ wird sowohl die unvollst\"andige Energie\"ubertragung zwischen zwei Atomen unterschiedlicher Masse (k) als auch die nicht dem Aufbau des Gitters entsprechende Lage des Fremdatoms an der Oberfl\"ache des Targets ({$\alpha$}) ber\"ucksichtigt. Eine halb quantitative Erkl\"arung der Unterschiede in den Energieverteilungen der Fremdionen und der Al+-Ionen ist mit Hilfe dieses Energie\"ubertragungsfaktors F m\"oglich. Eine genaue Betrachtung des Abl\"osevorganges erfordert die Ber\"ucksichtigung der Abl\"osungsenergie A, die abh\"angig ist vom Target, von der Art der emittierten Teilchen und davon, ob sie neutral oder ionisiert die Oberfl\"ache verlassen. Die Unterschiede in den Energieverteilungen gleicher Ionen aus verschiedenem Targetmaterial werden auf Unterschiede in der Verteilung der durch St\"o\ss e an die Oberfl\"ache transportierten Energie Ee, f\"ur die verschiedenen Kathoden zuruckgef\"uhrt. Die Tatsache, da\ss{} die Unterschiede in den Energieverteilungen mit Hilfe des Impuls\"ubertragungsmodelles befriedigend erkl\"art werden k\"onnen, stellt einen weiteren starken Beweis f\"ur die Richtigkeit der Impulstheorie dar, die auf Grund der von Wehner durchgef\"uhrten Zerst\"aubungsversuche an Einkristallen aufgestellt worden ist.}

The review is preferentially focused on experimental results and the corresponding experimental methods; theories about sputtering phenomena are used more as guide-lines for discussion and comparison. The four main areas considered are sputtering of (1) metals, (2) alkali halides, (3) frozen gases, and sputtering by (4) MeV ion impact on insulators. Analysis of the experimental data on energy and angular distributions has revealed a large variety of sputtering modes such as elastic and inelastic collisional sputtering, ion-induced thermal evaporation, ejection of excited atoms, sputtering due to exciton decay, formation of clusters or ejection of grains, sputtering by shock waves and formation of craters associated with an explosive gas flow. The comparison of experimental and theoretical data shows that the theory of linear collision cascades is a good basis for an understanding of the elastic sputtering processes. Also, recent computer simulations of sputtering give valuable insight into collisional processes. The situation is more complex when electronic excitation is the driving interaction of the sputtering process. In this case, depending on the type of target material and the energy loss of the primary ions, a large number of theoretical attempts have been made to describe individual phenomena attributed to electronic sputtering.}

This is achieved mainly by applying a new analytic formula for determining nuclear scattering angles based on the Moli\`ere potential, and by suitably expanding the distance between collisions at high energies.

The influence of the interatomic potential and the inelastic energy loss model as well as the surface binding energy on the sputtering yield is investigated. Further results are sputtering yields versus incident energy and angle as well as total angular distributions of sputtered particles and energy distributions in specific solid angles for non-normal incidence.

In both cases theory could be reconciled with experiment, but only if space charge, modified electric force due to the geometry of the system, effective density of the ball in the liquid for inertial force calculation and modified viscous drag due to a high Reynolds number of movement were taken into account.

Experimentally, conclusive evidence has been obtained for the existence of at least two excitation mechanisms: a collisional mechanism, which prevails in the production of multicharged ions, and a mechanism originating in the separation of the outgoing particle from its solid environment. The role of foreign atoms (host atoms in alloys, associated species in covalent and ionic compounds, surface contaminants such as oxygen and caesium), although often considerable, is not fully understood owing to the complex influence of the environment, and its description is at present limited mainly to some empirical rules of relative validity. Theoretically, if many approaches have been proposed, few prove to rely on valid physical foundations. Among the latter, an earlier theory which explains the emission of multicharged ions rather well, describes ionization in terms of Auger decay outside the target of collision-induced core hole excitations. In a second kind of approach, probably of more general significance, it is postulated that ionization results from the perturbation of outer atomic electrons during the separation of the outgoing particle from the surface. Its mathematical treatment has been made possible by recent progress in the many-body theory of localized time-dependent perturbations, but much work remains to be done in this direction. A third kind of approach, regarding ionization as induced by diffuse excitation of the surrounding electron gas, remains in the field of conjecture.}

The discharge is in pure argon at pressures in the 100 mtorr range, frequency 13.56 MHz, and rf voltage amplitudes on the order of 100 V. The model is based on solutions of the continuity, momentum (drift-diffusion), and energy equations for the electrons, continuity, and drift-diffusion equation for positive ions, coupled with the Poisson equation. The results of the model are qualitatively and quantitatively in good agreement with the experiments. The model predicts a maximum of plasma density off axis, as in the experiment. The ion current density on the electrode is also nonuniform, and increases radially in the conditions of the experiments. The effects of the rf voltage, pressure, and reactor geometry (electrode dimensions, gap length, guard rings, etc.) on the plasma properties and on the uniformity of the ion current on the powered electrode are also discussed. It is shown that the existence of a maximum of plasma density in the radial direction, in the conditions of the experiment, is due to the small value of the electrode spacing. The results show that the harmonic content of the discharge current is also geometry dependent. The comparisons show that 2D, three-moment fluid models can accurately describe the discharge and the effects of the chamber geometry on the plasma properties for pressure above the limit where collisionless electron heating does not play a significant role.}

This approach is based on the causal interpretation of the quantum theory, in which an electron, for example, is regarded as an inseparable union of a particle and afield. This field has, however, some new properties that can be seen to be the main sources of the differences between the quantum theory and the classical (Newtonian) theory. These new properties suggest that the field may be regarded as containing objective and active information, and that the activity of this information is similar in certain key ways to the activity of information in our ordinary subjective experience. The analogy between mind and matter is thus fairly close. This analogy leads to the proposal of the general outlines of a new theory of mind, matter, and their relationship, in which the basic notion is participation rather than interaction. Although the theory can be developed mathematically in more detail, the main emphasis here is to show qualitatively how it provides a way of thinking that does not divide mind from matter, and thus leads to a more coherent understanding of such questions than is possible in the common dualistic and reductionistic approaches. These ideas may be relevant to connectionist theories and might perhaps suggest new directions for their development.}

Moreover, the secondary electron yields on aluminium, stainless steel, copper, and amorphous silicon exposed to radio frequency argon, helium, and hydrogen plasmas are determined in situ, for the first time to our knowledge. In parallel-plate radio frequency dischargessecondary electron emission involves the contributions of ions, fast neutrals, metastables, and photons impinging on the electrode surfaces. Therefore, secondary electron emission must be considered as a global phenomenon. Global secondary electron emission can be up to ten times larger than only ion-induced secondary electron emission. Typically, the global emission coefficient is of the order of 0.1 (secondary electrons per ion) but can exceed 1 when the contribution of metastables is important. This is a noteworthy result since secondary electron emission is often neglected or underestimated in modeling of electrical discharges.}

  abstract = {The physical processes at the interface of a low-temperature plasma and a solid are extremely complex. They involve a huge number of elementary processes in the plasma, in the solid as well as charge, momentum and energy transfer across the interface. In the majority of plasma simulations these surface processes are either neglected or treated via phenomenological parameters such as sticking coefficients, sputter rates or secondary electron emission coefficients. However, those parameters are known only in some cases, so such an approach is very inaccurate and does not have predictive capability. Therefore, improvements are highly needed. In this paper we briefly summarize relevant theoretical methods from solid state and surface physics that are able to contribute to an improved simulation of plasma-surface interaction in the near future. Even though the (quantum-mechanical) equations of motion for the participating charged and neutral particles are known, in principle, full ab initio quantum simulations are feasible only for extremely short times and/or small system sizes. A substantial simplification is achieved when electronic quantum effects are not treated explicitly. Then one arrives at much simpler semi-classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the heavy particles that have become the main workhorse in surface science simulations. Using microscopically (i.e., density functional theory) founded potentials and force fields as an input, these MD simulations approach the quality of ab initio simulations, in many cases. However, despite their simplified nature, these simulations require a time step that is of the order or below one femtosecond making it prohibitive to reach experimentally relevant scales of seconds or minutes and system sizes of micrometers. To bridge this gap in length and time scales without compromising the first principles character and predictive power of the simulations, many physical and computational strategies have been put forward in surface science. This paper presents a brief overview on different methods and their underlying physical ideas, and we compare their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we discuss their potential relevance for future plasma-surface simulations. The first class are 'acceleration' techniques that include metadynamics, hyperdynamics, temperature accelerated dynamics, collective variable driven hyperdynamics and others. Recently we have presented a novel approach: selective process acceleration (Abraham et al 2016 J. Appl. Phys. 119 185301) which we discuss in some more detail. The second promising route to longer accurate simulations is dynamical freeze out of dominant modes which we have introduced recently for the simulation of neutral atom sticking on a metal surface (Filinov et al 2018 Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 27 064003). In this article we give a more general view on this method that allows to accurately combine first principles MD simulations with semi-analytical models and discuss possible applications that are of potential relevance for plasma physics.},

Measurements were carried out in a triple rf magnetron sputter deposition system using calorimetric probes in various Ar/N2 and Ar/H2 mixtures at typical substrate positions. By variation of the probe bias the different contributions originating from the kinetic energy of charge carriers, the recombination of charge carriers (electrons and ions) at the surface as well as the contributions from the impact of neutral sputtered particles and subsequent film growth were determined. Radial scans in the substrate plane were recorded to obtain information about inhomogeneities in the total energy influx. The results show that the crystallinity reaches its optimum at that Ar/N2 ratio where the influence of the bombarding ions reaches its lowest value, indicating the destructive character of ion impact. Radial measurements indicate the influence of the magnetic field on the homogeneity of the energy influx caused by the superposition of the three (balanced) magnetic configurations. The superposition leads to an 'unbalanced character' resulting in a lowering of the electron trapping. The admixture of H2 leads to a drastic increase in the energy influx due to molecule formation at the (substrate/probe) surface.},

The experimental validation of the theoretical considerations emphasizes the potential of the method for control in plasma processing. The possibility how the passive calorimetric probe can be used in continuous measurements for process monitoring without any feedback loops used by other probes, is finally discussed.},

DBDs are a typical example of nonthermal atmospheric or normal pressure gas discharges. Initially used for the generation of ozone, they have opened up many other fields of application. Therefore DBDs are a relevant tool in current plasma technology as well as an object for fundamental studies. Another motivation for further research is the fact that so-called partial discharges in insulated high voltage systems are special types of DBDs. The breakdown processes, the formation of structures, and the role of surface processes are currently under investigation. This review is intended to give an update to the already existing literature on DBDs considering the research and development within the last two decades. The main principles and different modes of discharge generation are summarized. A collection of known as well as special electrode configurations and reactor designs will be presented. This shall demonstrate the different and broad possibilities, but also the similarities and common aspects of devices for different fields of applications explored within the last years. The main part is devoted to the progress on the investigation of different aspects of breakdown and plasma formation with the focus on single filaments or microdischarges. This includes a summary of the current knowledge on the electrical characterization of filamentary DBDs. In particular, the recent new insights on the elementary volume and surface memory mechanisms in these discharges will be discussed. An outlook for the forthcoming challenges on research and development will be given.},

New data on tritium codeposition in beryllium was obtained with the tritium plasma experiment (TPE) facility. This shows codeposited HBe ratios of the order of 10\% for surface temperatures \$\textbackslash leq 300\$\textdegree C, beryllium thereby being similar to carbon in this respect. Hydrocarbon transport calculations show significant loss (10\textendash 20\%) of chemically sputtered carbon for detached conditions (\$Te \textbackslash approx 1\$ eV at the divertor), compared to essentially no loss (100\% redeposition) for higher temperature plasmas. Calculations also show a high, non-thermal, D-T molecular flux for detached conditions. Tritium codeposition rates for carbon are very high for detached conditions ( 20 g T/1000 s discharge), due to buildup of chemically sputtered carbon on relatively cold surfaces of the divertor cassette. Codeposition is lower ( 10X) for higher edge temperatures ( 8\textendash 30 eV) and is primarily due to divertor plate buildup of physically sputtered carbon. Peak net erosion rates for carbon are of the order of 30 cm/burn yr. Erosion and codeposition rates for beryllium are much lower than for carbon at detached conditions, but are similar to carbon for the higher temperatures. Both erosion and tritium codeposition are essentially nil for tungsten for the regimes studied.},

In spite of the differences between microplasmas which often obtain a quasi steady-state and single microdischarges or filaments which are self-limited in space and time and thus intrinsically transient, both face very similar diagnostic challenges of which two are immediately apparent: the high collisionality which requires adaptations of standard plasmas diagnostics often developed for low-pressure plasmas, and the requirements on high spatial resolution due to the strong gradients in plasma properties. The complexity of the plasma generation and the physical and chemical properties of the above-mentioned plasmas requires the knowledge of an extensive series of different parameters to obtain a full characterization. As the results of the diagnostics are not always unambiguous and require a detailed understanding of plasma physics and chemistry, a summary of the main properties and pecularities of high-pressure plasmas is included in this review.},

  abstract = {Experimental characterization is an essential task in development, qualification and optimization process of electric propulsion thrusters or ion beam sources for material processing, because it can verify that the thruster or ion beam source fulfills the requested mission or application requirements, and it can provide parameters for thruster and plasma modeling. Moreover, there is a need for standardizing electric propulsion thruster diagnostics in order to make characterization results of different thrusters and also from measurements performed in different vacuum facilities reliable and comparable. Therefore, we have developed an advanced electric propulsion diagnostic (AEPD) platform, which allows a comprehensive in-situ characterization of electric propulsion thrusters (or ion beam sources) and could serve as a standard on-ground tool in the future. The AEPD platform uses a five-axis positioning system and provides the option to use diagnostic tools for beam characterization (Faraday probe, retarding potential analyzer, ExB probe, active thermal probe), for optical inspection (telemicroscope, triangular laser head), and for thermal characterization (pyrometer, thermocamera). Here we describe the capabilities of the diagnostic platform and provide first experimental results of the characterization of a gridded ion thruster RIT-{$\mu$}X.}

In particular, the energy distribution of secondary particles and their influence on the ion beam deposition process of Ag was studied in dependence on process parameters. Energy-selective mass spectrometry was used to measure the energy distribution of sputtered and backscattered ions. The energy distribution of the sputtered particles shows, in accordance with theory, a maximum at low energy and an \textsuperscript{-2\$} decay for energies above the maximum. If the sum of incidence angle and polar emission angle is larger than 90\textdegree, additional contributions due to direct sputtering events occur. The energy distribution of the backscattered primary particles can show contributions by scattering at target particles and at implanted primary particles. The occurrence of these contributions depends again strongly on the scattering geometry but also on the primary ion species. The energy of directly sputtered and backscattered particles was calculated using equations based on simple two-particle-interaction whereas the energy distribution was simulated using the well-known Monte Carlo code TRIM.SP. In principal, the calculation and simulation data agree well with the experimental findings.}

Exemplarily, we obtain and characterize the surface temperature profile of the accelerator grid of a gridded ion thruster RIT-22. In-situ pyrometer line scans in combination with precise measurements of geometrical grid parameters are demonstrated. The accelerator grid surface temperature of the firing thruster is obtained by a model calculation which requires the knowledge of geometrical grid parameters, such as hole diameter, distance between holes or grid shape. These parameters are also measured in-situ with a telemicroscope for high-resolution optical imaging and a triangular laser head for surface profile scanning. The distance between grid surface and pyrometer optics are precisely monitored with the support of the triangular laser head, whose position is fixed with respect to the pyrometer. The distance measurement allows correcting the measurement spot size of the pyrometer. The temperature profiles at three different beam power levels (1250 W, 2250 W and 4000 W), and a warm-up and cool-down phase demonstrate the capabilities of the complex equipment. We find that thermal steady state is reached after 4 hours of thruster firing. Furthermore, we show that the accelerator grid surface temperature increases almost linearly with increasing beam current.}

  abstract = {There is an increasing demand for thin films with tailored properties, which requires the use and control of adequate deposition techniques. Ion beam sputter deposition (IBSD) is a physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique that is capable of fulfilling the technological challenges. In contrast to other PVD techniques, IBSD offers a unique opportunity to tailor the properties of the film-forming particles (sputtered target and scattered primary particles) and, hence, thin film properties. This is related to the fact that the generation and acceleration of the primary particles from the ion beam source, the generation of film-forming particles at the target, and thin film growth on the substrate are spatially separated. Thus, by changing ion beam parameters (ion species and ion energy) and geometrical parameters (ion incidence angle and emission angle), the energy distributions of the film-forming particles are modified. Even though in use for several decades, IBSD was not investigated systematically until lately. Utilizing the full potential of IBSD requires a comprehensive understanding of the physical processes. This tutorial describes the systematics of IBSD: The correlation between process parameters, properties of the film-forming particles, and thin film properties. The most important process parameters are the scattering geometry and the primary particle species. Depending on the material, different film properties can be influenced. Examples are adhesion, structural properties, composition, surface roughness, mass density, optical properties, stress, and electrical resistivity. In addition to the experimental results, fundamental physical aspects, experimental setups, and techniques for thin film deposition and particle characterization are described.},

In each case the conducting polymer overlayer allows the latex particles to acquire surface charge and hence be accelerated up to hypervelocities ({$>$}1 km s-1) using a Van de Graaff accelerator. These coated latexes have two main advantages compared to the sterically-stabilized polypyrrole particles of \$0.1-0.3\$ \$\textmu\$m diameter reported previously. First, a wider particle size range can be accessed. Second, the particle size distributions of the coated latexes are much narrower than those of the pure polypyrrole particles reported earlier. Preliminary studies confirm that, after charging and acceleration, these conducting polymer-coated latex particles have very similar mass-velocity profiles to those reported for colloidal iron particles in the hypervelocity literature. The hypervelocity impact generated ionization has been measured for latex spheres impacting copper targets. This is compared to previous work for impact ionization by iron particles, thus demonstrating the ability to study the dependence of impact ionization on widely different projectile materials.}

In the frame of this program the use of a Plasma Diagnostic Package (PDP) suitable for the HET propulsion is envisaged. In this scenario LABEN Proel Tecnologie Division is completing the development and proto-qualification (under ALCATEL contract) of a PDP, light and compact (less than 1.3 kg, included the electronics), based on a Retarding Potential Analyzer RPA) and a Langmuir Probe (LP). The PDP allows the collection of experimental data on energy distribution of ions in the periphery of the plasma beam, of plasma parameters and of erosion/contamination issues (this latter measurement is in charge of probes external to the PDP, being the interface to these probes managed inside the PDP). This paper presents the architecture of the PDP, its performances and operation modes, as well as a general overview on mass, dimensions and power breakdowns. The last part of the paper addresses the most significant tests of the proto-qualification test campaign.}

From the spectral measurements it was observed that the Boron emission intensity significantly increases for increased discharge voltage pointing to a large increase in the thruster wall erosion rate. Additionally, the measurements show that for the nominal discharge voltage and the applied magnetic field intensity, there is an optimum propellant flow rate for minimum Boron emission, thus minimum wall erosion rate. The variation in the current to the magnet coils showed that the Boron emission intensity increases for increased magnetic field and the Boron emission intensity shows similar behavior to that of the Xenon single ion emission line intensity at 248.911 nm. The findings of the study show that emission spectroscopy can be used in determining the optimum operational parameters for minimum wall erosion for SPT type Hall thrusters.},

We have measured forces as small as \textsuperscript{-4\$} N on a surface immersed in the plasma where small forces are due to ionic and neutral particles with kinetic energies on the order of a few eV impacting the surface. This instrument, a force sensor, uses a target plate surface! that is immersed in the plasma and connected to one end of an alumina rod while the opposite end of the alumina rod is mechanically connected to a titanium beam on which four strain gauges are mounted. The force on the target generates torque, causing strain in the beam. The resulting strain measurements can be correlated to a force on the target plate. The alumina rod electrically and thermally isolates the target plate from the strain gauge beam and allows the strain gauges to be located out of the plasma flow while also serving as a moment arm of several inches to increase the strain in the beam at the strain gauge location. These force measurements correspond directly to momentum flux and may be used with known plasma conditions to place boundaries on the kinetic energies of the plasma and neutral particles. The force measurements may also be used to infer thrust produced by a plasma propulsive device. Stainless steel, titanium, molybdenum, and aluminum flat target plates have been used. Momentum flux measurements of H\_2, D\_2, He, and Ar plasmas produced in a magnetized plasma device have been performed.}

Accurate results for both the magnitude and phase of the aperture field distribution and the transmission coefficients for the propagating modes are determined explicitly for a specific example of slots arranged in an equilateral triangular lattice. The balance of power flow between the reflected and the transmitted waves has been checked with satisfactory results. The solution can be applied to the problem of scattering from a conducting screen with periodic apertures and to the complementary problem of scattering from a set of conducting plates by the use of Babinet's principle.},

Here we ask the more general question of whether any improved predictions can be achieved by any extension of quantum theory. Under the assumption that measurements can be chosen freely, we answer this question in the negative: no extension of quantum theory can give more information about the outcomes of future measurements than quantum theory itself. Our result has significance for the foundations of quantum mechanics, as well as applications to tasks that exploit the inherent randomness in quantum theory, such as quantum cryptography.}

In PSII, targets to be implanted are placed directly in a plasma source and then pulse biased to a high negative potential. A plasma sheath forms around the target and ions bombard the entire target simultaneously. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that PSII: (1) efficiently implants ions to concentrations and depths required for surface modification, (2) produces material with improved microhardness and wear properties, and (3) dramatically improves the life of manufacturing tools in actual industrial applications. For example, the tool life of M-2 pierce punches used to produce holes in mild steel plate has been increased by a factor of 80.}

This effect has been investigated experimentally in a recent article by Thomas Trottenberg, Thomas Richter, and Holger Kersten from Kiel University/Germany [Eur. Phys. J. D 69, 91 (2015)]. The experimental results are impressive and have actually drawn the attention of the community to an interesting question which so far has been largely ignored. In addition to their experimental results the Kiel group proposes also a rough concept in order to explain their findings which provides certainly a basic qualitative understanding of the physical processes involved. However, on a closer inspection the picture developed so far is not entirely satisfying and the problem seems to require a more fundamental approach. This comment shows that the effect of the wall pressure can be described exactly using only analytical methods. The physical situation is analyzed by three different approaches. First, the simple case of only one spatial dimension is presented in detail. Second, the case of spherical symmetry is analyzed by some simplifying assumptions in order to investigate the effect of higher dimensionality. Third, a formal derivation for arbitrary geometry is given. This general result includes the one-dimensional case but does not allow a convenient connection between the pressures at the wall and in the center. Finally, the results are summarized and some conclusions are drawn.}

Optimally this is achieved with a dual-frequency discharge driven at a phase locked fundamental frequency and its second harmonic, e.g. 13.56 MHz and 27.12 MHz. An analytical model, a hybrid fluid/Monte-Carlo kinetic model as well as a Particle in Cell (PIC) simulation show that this Electrical Asymmetry Effect (EAE) leads to the generation of a DC self bias as a function of the phase between the applied voltage harmonics in geometrically symmetric as well as asymmetric discharges. The DC self bias depends almost linearly on the phase angle and the role of the electrodes (powered and grounded) can be reversed. At low pressures the EAE is self-amplifying due to the conservation of ion flux in the sheaths. By tuning the phase, precise and convenient control of the ion energy at the electrodes can be achieved, while the ion flux remains constant. The maximum ion energy can typically be changed by a factor of about three at both electrodes. At the same time the ion flux is constant within \$\textbackslash pm 5\$\%.},

Typically a few thousand anions are used for one nanoparticle. The resulting particle density and the charge on the particles are calculated with an iterative method. While the spatial distribution and the charge of the particles are influenced by the plasma, the presence of the nanoparticles will in turn influence the plasma properties.

The ion density measurements are valid in the main ion beam, but not in the charge exchange plasma. The electron density measurements are valid in the charge exchange plasma and in the downstream part of the ion beam, but not in its upstream part. In the regions where both results are valid, they agree within experimental accuracy. The composite result covers charged particle densities over the range \textsuperscript{10\$} cm\textsuperscript{-3\$}.}

The studies are carried out assuming that the positive ions are monoenergetic, as well as in more realistic approximation, assuming that the time-averaged energy distribution of ions impinging on the dust grain has a double-peaked hollow profile. For the nonmonoenergetic case, an analytical expression for the ion flux to the dust grain is obtained. It is studied how the dust charge and ion drag forces depend on the rf frequency, electron density at plasma-sheath boundary, electron temperature and ratio of the effective oscillation amplitude of rf current to the electron Debye length. It is shown that the dust charge and ion drag forces obtained in the monoenergetic ion approximation may differ from those calculated assuming that the ions are nonmonoenergetic. The difference increases with increasing the width of the ion energy spread in the ion distribution.}

Convergence of the approximations is checked by computing the properties of fully ionized hydrogen and of several other mixtures where the molecules interact with inverse-power repulsive potentials. From the results for hydrogen, it is seen that at least the third approximation should be used for the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusion coefficient, and the second approximation for the electrical conductivity and viscosity of ionized gases. These results contrast with those for un-ionized gases where one lower level of approximation is generally adequate.}

The self-consistent coupling of the equations is achieved by determining the material properties of the plasma from the dispersion relation of right-hand circularly polarized waves propagating parallel to the external magnetic field.

The pulsed ion beam was utilised for the investigation of the GaAs etching by chlorine. The dynamics of halogen?solid interactions could be studied under real processing conditions by varying the pulse length. In general, the etch rate of GaAs increases with decreasing pulse length at a given pulse frequency as a result of the increased chloride coverage of the surface.

A finite element model is used to examine the flow potential distribution in a truncated bounded region close to the spherical cavity. In order to give an appropriate artificial boundary condition at the truncated boundary, a transient infinite element, that is developed to describe transient flow in the exterior unbounded domain, is coupled with the finite element model. The coupling procedure of the finite and infinite elements at their interface is described by means of the boundary integro-differential equation rather than through a matrix approach. Consequently, a Neumann boundary condition can be applied at the truncated boundary to ensure the C1-continuity of the solution at the truncated boundary. Numerical analyses indicate that the proposed finite element-infinite element coupling approach can generate a correct artificial truncated boundary condition to the finite element model for the unbounded flow transport problem.},

Such materials can be found in an enormous variety of places, ranging from the powders used to make vitamin pills to the rings of Saturn, from beaches to grain elevators, and from pottery clay to interstellar dust. Granular materials have interested physicists from Coulomb and Faraday to Reynolds and Rayleigh, but only recently have mathematical and experimental methods been developed to analyze their properties in detail. This text develops the fundamental physics of the behavior of granular materials. It covers the basic properties of flow, friction, and fluidization of uniform granular materials; discusses mixing and segregation of heterogeneous materials (the famous "brazil-nut problem"); and concludes with an introduction to numerical models. The presentation begins with simple experiments and uses their results to build concepts and theorems about materials whos16e behavior is often quite counter-intuitive; it aims to present in a unified way the background needed to understand current work in the field. Developed for students at the University of Paris, the text will be suitable for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students; it should also be of interest to researchers and engineers just eentering the field.}

Therefore, a parallelisation strategy of the code is presented to reduce computational time. The calculated ion beam angular distributions in the plume region are quite sensitive to boundary conditions of the potential, possible additional source contributions (e.g. from secondary electron emission at vessel walls) and charge exchange collisions. Within this work a model for secondary electrons emitted from the vessel wall is included. In order to account for limits of the model due to its limited domain size, a correction of the simulated angular ion energy distribution by the potential boundary is presented to represent the conditions at the location of the experimental measurement in distance. In addition, a post-processing procedure is suggested to include charge exchange collisions in the plume region not covered by the original PIC simulation domain for the simulation of ion angular distributions measured at distance.},

The plasma generates many harmonics on the fundamental, the first few being strongest. This gives a multi-harmonic rf voltage across the probe sheath that is removed by applying a rf signal to the probe that is matched both in amplitude and in phase for each harmonic. The probe I-V characteristic can then be analysed using dc theory. We show here that only when the rf harmonic amplitude approaches about 2Te is it necessary to compensate for that harmonic. For the commercial processing rig used this only occurs for the second harmonic at low pressures, {$<$} 5\texttimes 10-3 mbar. Here the addition of second-harmonic compensation shifts the probe I-V curve, making it markedly more positive than for fundamental-only compensation. Despite this the values obtained for the electron density ne and temperature Te changed by less than 10\%. For most plasmas in which the harmonics have amplitudes below Te the use of fundamental-only compensation is adequate for all but the most precise measurements.}

Parts I and II contained compilations of experimental data on ionic mobilities and diffusion coefficients (both longitudinal and transverse) for ions in neutral gases (almost exclusively at room temperature) in an externally applied field. The data were tabulated as a function of the ionic energy parameter E/N, where E is the electric field intensity and N is the number density of the gas. The coverage of the literature extended up to about August 1978. The criteria for selection of the mobility and diffusion data were (1) the measurements must cover a reasonably wide range of E/N, (2) the identity of the ions must be well established, and (3) the accuracy of the data must be good. Recent important development in the transport theory of gaseous ions were outlined, and utilized to derive quantities from the experimental data that are useful in various applications. The present paper (Part III) extends all aspects of Parts I and II into 1983. In addition, here we compile zero-field mobilities as a function of the gas temperature, zero-field mobilities at fixed gas temperatures, and ratios of the transverse diffusion coefficient to the mobility as a function of E/N. In this compilation we include some experimental data obtained without mass spectrometric selection of the ions, but only in cases where there is little or no uncertainty about the identity of the ions and no confusion related to ion-molecule reactions on the part of the drifting ions.},

  abstract = {In plasma chemistry, commercially available systems of combined ion energy and mass analyzers are commonly used for plasma parameter control in processes like plasma supported film deposition or surface modifications. The usualway tomeasure ion distribution functions by those analyzers is to change the reference potential of the analyzer thereby scanning the distribution function. For interpreting measured ion distribution functions we describe the principle of such a combined ion mass and energy analyzer and calculate the measured ion current and its relation to the ion distribution function. In thisway, we showthat the measured ion current versus the reference potential of the energy analyzer represents a velocity distribution function versus energy. Furthermore, we discuss in howfar it is possible to evaluate from this velocity distribution function the total ion current densities and the energy carried by the ions onto a surface exposed to plasma.}

Influence of working conditions on the average ion energy and on the ion energy spread in the beam is described. Energy spread has typical values between 8 and 25 eV. Average ion energy can change due to variations of ion source working conditions (at constant extraction voltages) up to 60 eV. Increase of both the average ion energy and ion energy spread is observed with increasing rf power coupled to the plasma (20-100 W). This correlates to the increasing amplitude of plasma floating potential oscillation. Average ion energy decreasesw ith increasingm agnetic induction (O-75 mT) and with increasing pressure in the vacuum chamber (2 X 10\^-4-1.8 X 10\^-3 mbar) due to decreasing cathode oscillation amplitudes. Average ion energy decreases with increasing distance from the broad beam axis because of chromatical and spherical aberrations of the source extraction optics. Multiple peaks in the ion energy spectrum are observed. Their occurrence can be explained by charge exchange effects in the rf oscillating plasma sheath.}

The high degree of accuracy achieved in the experimental determination of the law of motions of droplets through gases, makes a careful theoretical examination of the problem desirable. Assuming the usual Maxwellian distribution of velocities in the gas, the force exerted by the impinging molecules is found to be M where M=(4?/3) Nma2cmV, N, m, a, and cm being the number per unit volume, mass, radius, and mean speed of the molecules and V the speed of the droplet. The force exerted by the molecules leaving the surface depends on how they leave. (1) For uniform evaporation from the whole surface, the force is -M; (2) for specular reflection of all the impinging molecules, -M; (3) for diffuse reflection with unchanged distribution of velocities, -(13/9)M; (4) for diffuse reflection with the Maxwell distribution corresponding to the effective temperature of the part of the surface they come from, -(1+9?/64)M, for a non-conducting droplet (4a), and -(1+?/8)M, for a perfectly conducting droplet (4b). Cases (1) and (2) can not be distinguished experimentally, but (2) is more probable physically. The experimental values agree with 1/10 specular reflection, case (2), and 9/10 diffuse reflection, case (4a) or (4b). For large values of l/a, the droplet behaves like a perfect conductor, case (4b). (2) Comparatively large spheres. The distribution of velocities is no longer Maxwellian because of the hydrodynamic stresses which can not now be neglected. The new law is derived (Eq. 47). The conditions at the surface of the sphere are discussed and it is shown that the diffusely reflected molecules have a Maxwellian distribution corresponding to the temperature and density of the gas, just as though they were reflected with conservation of velocity (specularly). The assumptions of Bassett are theoretically justified and a complete confirmation is obtained for the correction factor for Stokes' law [1+0.7004 (2/s-1) (l/a)] on which Millikan's conclusions are based, especially as to the percentage of specular reflection. (3) Rotating spheres are also considered in an appendix, and the values of the resistance are derived for various cases.}

Analyzers are grouped into two classifications: 1) mirror-type analyzers, and 2) deflector-type analyzers. Common mirror-type analyzers are the parallel-plate mirror analyzer and the cylindrical mirror analyzer. For deflector-type analyzers, a generalized toroidal type is first described and the commonly used cylindrical deflector and spherical deflector analyzers are discussed as special cases. The procedure for energy resolution calculations of electrostatic analyzers is described, which is a common way of comparing analyzers. Ion energy distributions from a spherical deflector analyzer are presented, comparing variations in 1) particle energy, 2) particle angle, 3) the entrance and exit geometry of the analyzer, and 4) sector angle using numerical calculations.},

When either v\_0 or E\_0 is sufficiently large, however, the exact solution may differ appreciably from the Child-Langmuir law. The existence of a closed-form expression for the spatial variation of the sheath potential is shown to be contingent upon the satisfaction of a simple inequality relating v\_0 and E\_0 to J. When v\_0 obeys the Bohm criterion and the magnitude of E\_0 suggests that the Bohm energy is acquired over a distance not less than one Debye length, this inequality is indeed satisfied.}

A vacuum deposition chamber is set up to measure the energy and spatial distribution of secondary particles produced by ion beam sputtering of different target materials under variation of geometrical parameters (incidence angle of primary ions and emission angle of secondary particles) and of primary ion beam parameters (ion species and energies). A representative set of Ag thin films is deposited arranged on a substrate holder equatorial to the Ag target in steps of 10\textdegree{} and characterized concerning their film thickness by profilometry to determine the angular distribution of the sputtered particles. The film thickness distributions show a tilted, cosine-like shape and a shifting of the maximum position depending on the primary particle energy and incidence angle of the primary ions. The energy distributions of sputtered and scattered ions and of sputtered neutrals are measured with an energy-selective mass spectrometer. The average energy of the sputtered ions increases with increasing emission angle and also increases with increasing incidence angle of the primary ions. In contrast, the average energy of the sputtered ions is nearly unaffected by the primary particle energy and particle species. The energy distribution of the scattered Ar ions reveals high energetic maxima which shift with increasing emission angle to higher energies. These maxima are not observed for Xe bombardment. The total energies of sputtered and scattered ions show significant differences between the two bombarding species. The maximum of the energy distribution of sputtered Ag neutrals is used to conclude on the surface binding energy of Ag (2.72 eV).

The cross section of these collisions increases with a decrease of electron temperature below the threshold value of 0.79 eV. In addition, probe measurements in a similar, but symmetrically driven parallel plate discharge optimized for use with Langmuir probes are presented to give independent evidence to the rapid decrease of electron temperature when the transition occurs.}

The electrochemical characteristics are very sensitive to the nature of the polymer, its content, and location. The presence of surface polymer hinders Li insertion in these materials (by comparison to materials without surface polymer) and appears to result in the partial entrapment of Li ions. For modified [PANI],VV2O,, polymer incorporation results in better reversibility and increased Li capacity in the nanocomposite. [PPY]\_0,40V\_2O\_5 displays a greater first discharge capacity than the respective PANI material, but is not as cyclable as in O,-[PANI]\_0.40V\_2O\_5. 0\_2-treatment results in the reformation of a high-potential Li site that is lost during the reductive intercalative polymerization. Li chemical diffusion coefficients are greater for the O\_2-[PANI]V\_2O\_5 nanocomposite than the xerogel by one order of magnitude, resulting in better performance at high current densities.

Description is made of a feedback network which is used to stabilize rf potentials and plasma parameters over periods of several hours. The calibration of a focused X-band microwave interferometer indicates that the presence of the Pyrex plasma container has no noticeable effect on the electron density deduced from phase-shift measurements. At a pressure of 0.7 Torr in argon, space-resolved electron temperatures, deduced from symmetrical and asymmetrical double-probe I-V characteristics, indicate that the electron temperature is radially constant in the plasma column, and has a value which is 25\% higher than that predicted by using the von Engel and Steenbeck theory for a similar positive column. The radially integrated charge density profile, deduced from the probe ion current using the collisionless Laframboise theory, agrees within 15\% with that estimated from measurements made with a microwave interferometer. Collision-dominated probe theories are also considered and found to be less applicable.}

  abstract = {This paper reports the performance of a fully-integrated MEMS planar electrospray thruster array operating in the pure ion-emission regime. Electrospray thrusters work by electrostatically extracting and accelerating ions or charged droplets from a liquid surface to produce thrust. Emission occurs from sharp emitter tips, which enhance the electric field and constrain the emission location. Electrospray propulsion is desirable for its simplicity, high thrust efficiency and tunable specific impulse. However, the electrospray process limits the thrust from a single tip. Consequently, achieving millinewton thrust levels requires an array with tens of thousands of emitters. We have used silicon batch microfabrication technology to make an array of 502 emitters in a 113 mm\^2 area. The thruster, weighing 5 g, was tested with the ionic liquid EMI-BF4, and was previously shown to operate in the pure ion-emission regime, with a total thrust of up to 13 {$\mu$}N and a 3000 s specific impulse. Typical operating ranges are from 500 V to 2000 V. Imprints taken by firing the emitter array against a target show all the emitters operating. Emission non-uniformities occur with a wavelength of a few emitter spacings, compatible with fabrication non-uniformities, but not with competition between neighboring emitters. Temperature-dependent current-voltage characteristics are reported which could be explained by Iribarne-Thompson ion evaporation directly from the liquid surface without formation of a Taylor cone. This emission regime had not been hypothesized heretofore.}

  abstract = {We report the development of a method for the measurement of electric fields in glow discharge plasmas, based on Stark spectroscopy of argon atoms. The method is based on laser excitation of transitions in atomic argon. The key feature of the method is that the electric field is determined by matching experimentally obtained absorption spectra to theoretically calculated spectra. The dependence of the positions of energy levels of argon atoms on the strength of the electric field was calculated by solving the Schro\textasciidieresis dinger equation for the argon atom. Measurements of Stark spectra were made in the sheath region of a glow discharge using laser optogalvanic spectroscopy. The wavelength of the laser radiation was tuned to the transitions 4s ={$>$} n f (n57,8, . . . ,14) of the argon atom. For n511, the lower limit for electric field measurements was estimated to be 14 V/mm.},

The probe data were sampled at high frequency during its motion, and a Bayesian methodology was used to reliably infer the plasma properties from the instantaneous voltage and current measurements. In order to model the interaction of the electrodes with the plasma, a parameterization of the Laframboise sheath solution was used. Data were collected continuously during the probe motion from the plume up to the near-anode region of the thruster, allowing for the reconstruction of the salient features of the plasma oscillations as a function of axial location. A time-frequency analysis of the measured plasma properties based on wavelets was then performed to gain insight into the evolution and phase shift of the oscillations over the investigated plasma domain. The developed diagnostic method can provide quantitative information on the instantaneous value of plasma density, electron temperature, and plasma potential along the thruster centerline with good spatial resolution and has proved to be a valid approach to investigate breathing mode oscillations in Hall thruster plasmas.},

Ion energies explored in this study range from 50 to 250eV. Films are deposited on [100] n-type silicon wafers and are characterized by a variety of analytical methods to determine film hardness, density, and stress. It is shown that the maximum film density (1.7g/cm3) and hardness (18GPa) correspond to conditions of maximum deposition rate (5\texttimes 10-6g/s) and maximum film stress (1.8GPa) all at ion energies of approximately 160eV.

Measurements were made in a 13.56-MHz capacitive argon rf discharge at two gas pressures: p=0.03 Torr, where stochastic electron heating is dominant, and p=0.3 Torr, where collisional electron heating dominates. Thus, the measured EEDF at each gas pressure manifests a distinct departure from thermodynamic equilibrium being bi-Maxwellian at 0.03 Torr and Druyvesteyn-like at 0.3 Torr. Considerable differences in electron density and temperature were obtained from the different parts of the probe characteristic and these values differ dramatically in many cases from those found from integration of the measured EEDF's, thus demonstrating that using standard procedures in non-Maxwellian plasma can give misleading results.}

This section includes a description of correct probe design, the influence of circuit resistance, ion current and plasma oscillations and probe-surface effects on measurements. At present, the Druyvesteyn method is the most developed, consistent and routine way to measure the EDF. The following section of the review describes an extension of the classical EDF measurements into higher pressures, magnetic fields and anisotropic plasmas. To date, these methods have been used by a very limited number of researchers. Therefore, their verification has not yet been fully completed, and their reliable implementation still requires additional research.

The separation of the peaks yielded an absolutely calibrated measure of the ion drift velocity, while the height of the peaks gave the ion density. As expected, in the sheath the measured ion density was lower and the velocity was higher than in this plasma. Using these measurements, it was confirmed that the ion flux is conserved in a sheath. The spatial profiles of ion velocity and density in the sheath were used to test a time-independent two-fluid theory, and good agreement was found.

The arrangement of the vacuum vessel and fluorescence detection optics provides the means for an independent selection of the observed emission direction and the angle of incidence. A pulsed ion gun is applied to bombard the target with noble gas ions in the energy range between 200 and 500 eV. The target assembly allows the preparation of thin metal films by evaporation on optically polished glass substrates without break of the vacuum.

The bombardment at both the normal and the oblique incidence of the ion beam are contained in the investigation. Pronounced anisotropic effects are observed in both cases.

The ion densities inside the dust cloud and in the ambient plasma are found equal, while the electron density is reduced inside the dust cloud. The measured potentials are compared with current models. Inclusion of the bi-Maxwellian distribution of the electrons leads to an improved description in the limit of low dust density. The strong increase of the floating and cloud potential for high dust density, predicted by the constant ion density model, is not confirmed.}

The primary excitation and ionization processes specific for this discharge are pointed out. The calculations show that, in a wide range of external conditions, the homogeneous barrier discharge in nitrogen has a form of Townsend discharge which is easy to study. The influence of different mechanisms of electron emission from dielectric barriers and surface recombination over the electrical characteristics of a barrier discharge is studied. Introduction of a finite lifetime at the surface for adsorbed electrons allows us to obtain the results qualitatively corresponding to the experimental data.}

A highly innovative and low budget mission to explore the Moon, SMART-1 was launched on the 27th of September 2003 as an Ariane 5 cyclade-like auxiliary payload and uses a Hall thrusters (PPS1350) built by SNECMA. On 13 November 2004, Smart-1 reached the Moon capture point, 60000 km from the lunar surface. The amount of propellant required to transfer the spacecraft from GTO (650 km perigee and 35880 km apogee) to a Moon orbit (300 km over the lunar south pole and 3000 km over the lunar north pole) has been of 75 kg of Xenon. The life of SMART-1 has been extended 1 year until mid 2006. SMART-1 will serve as test-bench for other missions using EP. The possible plume interaction effects of the PPS1350 on the SMART-1 spacecraft are being assessed by means of several diagnostics: the Electric Propulsion diagnostic Package (EPDP) and the Spacecraft Potential and Electric fields and Dust Experiment (SPEDE). The diagnostics on-board any spacecraft using electric propulsion will only give punctual values. Therefore, it is important to develop models that permit to forecast the effects of the use of such thrusters in the whole spacecraft. The data collected in this flight experiment will be used not only to assess the impact of using electric propulsion on board satellites but furthermore to validate modelling tools which will be employed in a full characterisation of the impact of using this technology in space.},

This occurs under conditions relevant to both plasma processing discharges and plasma crystal experiments. The void results from a balance of the electrostatic and ion drag forces on a dust particle. The ion drag force is driven by a flow of ions outward from an ionization source and toward the surrounding dust cloud, which has a negative space charge. In equilibrium the force balance for dust particles requires that the boundary with the dust cloud be sharp, provided that the particles are cold and monodispersive. Numerical solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear fluid equations are carried out including dust charging and dust-neutral collisions, but not ion-neutral collisions. The regions of parameter space that allow stable void equilibria are identified. There is a minimum ionization rate that can sustain a void. Spatial profiles of plasma parameters in the void are reported. In the absence of ion-neutral collisions, the ion flow enters the dust cloud's edge at Mach number \$M = 1\$. Phase diagrams for expanding or contracting voids reveal a stationary point corresponding to a single stable equilibrium void size, provided the ionization rate is constant. Large voids contract and small voids expand until they attain this stationary void size. On the other hand, if the ionization rate is not constant, the void size can oscillate. Results are compared to recent laboratory and microgravity experiments.},

Also, the low ion energy etching of Si and SiO2 was demonstrated in CF4 and SiF4 plasmas utilizing the dual excitation system.

This property makes them interesting objects for fundamental scientific research. Furthermore, there are also the possibilities for applications in the field space propulsion. As there is a lack of fundamental understanding of these plasma phenomena, this article aims to enhance the physical knowledge of fireballs by presenting a mathematical model for the calculation of the force that can be provided by them. It will be shown that all the main plasma parameters such as the plasma potential and the electron density can be derived completely with the knowledge of the potential of the electrode and the radial electron temperature profile. The calculations show very good agreement with the experimental data if two species of electrons (i.e., fast and slow) are considered. Both electron populations have different temperature profiles as is shown with measurements. Furthermore, it will be demonstrated that the potential drop throughout the fireball is much larger than previously thought and that this larger potential drop can considerably contribute to the acceleration of ions in the double layer. This mechanism makes it more likely that the force exerted by the fireball is rather caused by heating of the neutrals via collisions with those accelerated ions and the high energetic ions themselves than by collisions between fast electrons and neutrals.}

Electric charges of particulate matter in the magnetosphere and its consequences will be studied; e.g., the effects of the magnetic field on the trajectories of dust particles and fragmentation of particles due to electrostatic disruption.

It is a multicoincidence detector with a mass sensitivity 106 times higher than that of previous in-situ experiments which measured dust in the outer solar system. The instrument weighs 4.2 kg, consumes 2.4 W, and has a normal data transmission rate of 24 bits s-1 in nominal spacecraft tracking mode. On December 29, 1989 the instrument was switched-on. After the instrument had been configured to flight conditions cruise science data collection started immediately. In the period to May 18, 1990 at least 168 dust impacts have been recorded.

  abstract = {Multi-dipolar plasmas are sustained in large-volume chambers by a network of antennas located at the wall. Each antenna consists of a permanent magnet, trapping electrons in an axisymmetric dipole field, and a microwave applicator, heating the trapped electrons by cyclotron resonance (ECR). This paper presents a two-dimensional self-consistent model of a plasma sustained by one such antenna. The microwave fields and power absorption are calculated from the Maxwell equations coupled with a local electron momentum equation by an adaptation of the finite difference time domain method. The plasma is described by fluid equations for magnetized electrons and inertial ions, where quasi-neutrality is imposed through a semi-implicit numerical method based on Poisson's equation, which also yields the sheath potentials. Steady-state model results for argon show that below the critical plasma density (7.4 \texttimes{} 1016 m\^-3) the microwave power is absorbed in a narrow region all along the ECR surface around the end of the antenna; beyond this density the main absorption occurs near the plasma edge. Although the electron temperature varies considerably across the magnetic field lines, the plasma potential is nearly uniform all around the antenna and is controlled by the maximum electron temperature.}

  abstract = {Plasma transport across magnetic field lines plays a key role not only in hot fusion plasmas but also in low-temperature plasma sources operating at low pressure, which often rely on external magnetic fields for their operation. Transport in these sources involves different physics than that in fusion plasmas: the ions are not (completely) magnetized, the plasma is sensitive to wall effects because the magnetic field lines intercept the chamber walls, and the neutral gas density is often much larger than the plasma density. This paper gives an overview of the main principles of magnetized low-temperature plasma transport as they are currently understood, including recent insights on the role of magnetic drift. Three important forms of magnetized low-temperature plasma transport are discussed: magnetized plasma diffusion, transport in E \texttimes{} B fields and magnetic drift. These phenomena are illustrated with recent numerical modeling results on a dipolar microwave source, an End-Hall ion source, and simplified version of the ITER negative ion source. For the latter source it is shown that obstructed magnetic drift can lead to plasma asymmetry and increased cross-field transport.}

  abstract = {Fluid models of gas discharges require the input of transport coefficients and rate coefficients that depend on the electron energy distribution function. Such coefficients are usually calculated from collision cross-section data by solving the electron Boltzmann equation (BE). In this paper we present a new user-friendly BE solver developed especially for this purpose, freely available under the name BOLSIG+, which is more general and easier to use than most other BE solvers available. The solver provides steady-state solutions of the BE for electrons in a uniform electric field, using the classical two-term expansion, and is able to account for different growth models, quasi-stationary and oscillating fields, electron-neutral collisions and electron-electron collisions. We show that for the approximations we use, the BE takes the form of a convection-diffusion continuity-equation with a non-local source term in energy space. To solve this equation we use an exponential scheme commonly used for convection-diffusion problems. The calculated electron transport coefficients and rate coefficients are defined so as to ensure maximum consistency with the fluid equations. We discuss how these coefficients are best used in fluid models and illustrate the influence of some essential parameters and approximations.}

  abstract = {Numerical fluid models are widely used in gas discharge physics. A typical discharge model comprises continuity equations and drift\textendash diffusion equations for reactive particle species, a balance equation for the electron energy, and Poisson's equation for the electric field. When this system of equations is integrated numerically with respect to time, the explicit evaluation of coupled quantities necessitates strong time step restrictions, resulting in an enormous slowdown of the calculation. The strongest time step restriction arises from an explicit treatment of the coupling between the charged particle transport and the space charge field. In order to circumvent this constraint several implicit and semi-implicit techniques have been developed. When one uses these techniques, however, the explicit handling of the dependence of electron energy source term on the electron mean energy becomes limiting for the time step. In this work we present a technique for the implicit treatment of the electron energy source term, based on linearization with respect to the electron mean energy. This approach makes it possible to increase the time step by several orders of magnitude, thus giving a tremendous speedup of the calculation. Test results are provided for some typical cases, covering a wide range of numerical conditions.}

We present recent measurements of electron- and photon-stimulated desorption of neutral alkali atoms from LiF and NaCI which attempt to answer these questions by providing details of energy dependence, velocity distributions and variations in the desorption yield as a function of surface temperature. The ground-state neutral desorption dynamics under both electron and photon irradiation are consistent with a model in which halogens are ejected from the surface in a focused collision sequence, while the neutral alkalis are desorbed thermally. However, the excited-state neutrals do not follow this pattern, and further measurements to understand excited-state neutral desorption will be necessary. The implications of the experimental data for an understanding of the desorption mechanism-such as correlations with specific core-level excitations and with mobilities of electronically-induced defects-will be discussed.}

  abstract = {Objectives. Purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of surface modifications on the tensile bond strength between zirconia ceramic and resin. Methods. Zirconia ceramic surfaces were treated with 150-{$\mu$}m abrasive alumina particles, 150-{$\mu$}m abrasive zirconia particles, argon-ion bombardment, gas plasma, and piranha solution (H2SO4:H2O2 = 3:1). In addition, slip casting surfaces were examined. Untreated surfaces were used as the control group. Tensile bond strengths (TBS) were measured after water storage for 3 days or 150 days with additional 37,500 thermal cycling for artificial aging. Statistical analyses were performed with 1-way and 3-way ANOVA, followed by comparison of means with the Tukey HSD test. Results. After storage in distilled water for three days at 37 \textdegree C, the highest mean tensile bond strengths (TBS) were observed for zirconia ceramic surfaces abraded with 150-{$\mu$}m abrasive alumina particles (TBSAAP = 37.3 MPa, TBSCAAP = 40.4 MPa), and 150-{$\mu$}m abrasive zirconia particles (TBSAZP = 34.8 MPa, TBSCAZP = 35.8 MPa). Also a high TBS was observed for specimens treated with argon-ion bombardment (TBSBAI = 37.8 MPa). After 150 days of storage, specimens abraded with 150-{$\mu$}m abrasive alumina particles and 150-{$\mu$}m abrasive zirconia particles revealed high TBS (TBSAAP = 37.6 MPa, TBSCAAP = 33.0 MPa, TBSAZP = 22.1 MPa and TBSCAZP = 22.8 MPa). A high TBS was observed also for specimens prepared with slip casting (TBSSC = 30.0 MPa). A decrease of TBS was observed for control specimens (TBSUNT = 12.5 MPa, TBSCUNT = 9.0 MPa), specimens treated with argon-ion bombardment (TBSBAI = 10.3 MPa) and gas plasma (TBSGP = 11.0 MPa). A decrease of TBS was observed also for specimens treated with piranha solution (TBSPS = 3.9 MPa, TBSCPS = 4.1 MPa). A significant difference in TBS after three days storage was observed for specimens treated with different methods (p {$<$} 0.001). Thermal cycling significantly reduced TBS for all groups (p {$<$} 0.001) excluding groups: AAP(p {$>$} 0.05), CAAP(p {$>$} 0.05) and SC(p {$>$} 0.05). However, the failure patterns of debonded specimens prepared with 150-{$\mu$}m abrasive zirconia particles were 96.7\% cohesive. Conclusion. Treatment of zirconia ceramic surfaces with abrasive zirconia particles is a promising method to increase the tensile bond strength without significant damage of the ceramic surface itself. An alternative promising method is slip casting.},

The results of performing ostensibly identical measurements on six of these cells in five different laboratories are analyzed and discussed. Measurements were made of plasma voltage and current characteristics for discharges in pure argon at specified values of applied voltages, gas pressures, and gas flow rates. Data are presented on relevant electrical quantities derived from Fourier analysis of the voltage and current wave forms. Amplitudes, phase shifts, self-bias voltages, and power dissipation were measured. Each of the cells was characterized in terms of its measured internal reactive components. Comparing results from different cells provides an indication of the degree of precision needed to define the electrical configuration and operating parameters in order to achieve identical performance at various laboratories. The results show, for example, that the external circuit, including the reactive components of the rf power source, can significantly influence the discharge. Results obtained in reference cells with identical rf power sources demonstrate that considerable progress has been made in developing a phenomenological understanding of the conditions needed to obtain reproducible discharge conditions in independent reference cells.}

Collisions are assumed to occur only with "fixed" lattice atoms, but binding energies are neglected. The distribution functions exhibit finite discontinuities in the energy which approximate the behavior of the correct functions. The sputtering ratio is determined by integration over the velocity direction and also over energy, thus averaging out the approximation. The resulting expression for the sputtering ratio depends upon four atomic parameters of the system. In principle all are measurable, but only the mass ratio is known with precision at the present time. The theoretical curve is fitted to the experimental data which are available for eight ion-metal combinations. The curve is found to be very sensitive to the choice of fitting parameters, and the parameters exhibit considerable internal consistency. The theory indicates certain areas of experimental research which should add to present understanding of the process.}

Tabulations from the Handbook for MAP 16 are the primary guide for the lower atmosphere and are supplemented by historical rocket and incoherent scatter data in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Low-order spherical harmonics and Fourier series are used to describe the major variations throughout the atmosphere including latitude, annual, semiannual, and simplified local time and longitude variations. While month to month details cannot be completely represented, lower atmosphere temperature data are fit to an overall standard deviation of 3 K and pressure to 2\%. Comparison with rocket and other data indicates that the model represents current knowledge of the climatological average reasonably well, although there is some conflict as to details near the mesopause.}

Soc. 129, 2764 (1982)] is a novel technique which promises to have wide application in the semiconductor industry for the removal of silicon and polymeric materials. Its advantages include relatively high concentrations of both ions and chemically excited species and the ability to etch isotropically. This allows high etch rates to be achieved with a minimum of ion bombardment. Langmuir probe studies have been performed on microwave (915 MHz) plasmas in O2 to determine the spatial variation of the plasma parameters (ion density, electron temperature, and space potential), as well as their dependence on gas pressure, microwave power, and the addition of CF4. Probes have also been used in microwave plasmas with an rf bias applied to an internal electrode (combination plasmas). Ion densities on the order of 2 x 10\^10 cm\^-3 were typical in the spatial afterglow of microwave plasmas with an O2 pressure of 100 mTorr, and values as high as 7\texttimes 1010 cm\^-3 were observed at lower pressures. Average electron temperatures between 1 and 2 eV were prevalent in the microwave plasmas while rf biasing the substrate electrode leads to a value of 7 eV near the etching surface.}

For this purpose, the wall-bound surplus charge arising from the plasma is modeled as a quasistationary electron surface layer in thermal equilibrium with the wall. It satisfies Poisson's equation and minimizes the grand canonical potential of wall-thermalized excess electrons. Based on an effective model for a graded interface taking into account the image potential and the offset of the conduction band to the potential just outside the dielectric, we specifically calculate the modification of the potential and the distribution of the surplus electrons for MgO, SiO2, and Al2O3 surfaces in contact with a helium discharge. Depending on the electron affinity of the surface, we find two vastly different behaviors. For negative electron affinity, electrons do not penetrate into the wall and a quasi-two-dimensional electron gas is formed in the image potential, while, for positive electron affinity, electrons penetrate into the wall and a negative space-charge layer develops in the interior of the dielectric. We also investigate how the non-neutral electron surface layer\textendash which can be understood as the ultimate boundary of a bounded gas discharge\textendash merges with the neutral bulk of the dielectric.}

Varying the potential of this probe disclosed that some electrons ejected from the probe surface and hence from all cathode walls penetrate into the dark space opposite to the surface of their origin. These electrons can reach the opposite wall if the pressure and the cathode diameter are too low, in which case they will be removed. This removal causes the hollow cathode discharge to extinguish at higher pressures than is the case for linear discharges. Electrons that cross the cathode cavity entirely can pass through a small hole in the cathode wall into a high vacuum chamber and be analysed energetically. The same experiment also discloses the energy distribution of electrons leaving the cathode surface. A comparison with the theory recently published 3 shows that pendelelectrons can be responsible for the currrent amplification observed in the hollow cathode discharge.}

Due to the scattering geometry only the energy distribution perpendicular to the magnetic field could be measured. Our results show that in low-density plasmas the eedf significantly deviates from Maxwellian for electron energies larger than approximately 20 eV. We found a highly-energetic tail whose development can be explained by the heating of the electrons by the ECR process and the trapping of these hot electrons in the magnetic mirror field.

In addition to material characterizations (electron microscopy and chemical analysis), the gas-phase temperature distribution and composition are investigated by combining several in situ and ex situ diagnostics. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) on TMS and H2 (produced from TMS decomposition) in the hot zone of the reactor gives the rotational temperature distribution of the molecules and their concentrations. Within a few mean free paths from the surface, the H2 gas temperature is lower than the surface temperature. This is due to a nonunity accommodation coefficient a of H2 on Sic. A simple analytical model yields a = 0.05 for H2 on Sic. Using gas transport coefficients and the experimental value of a for H2, a twdhensional numerical code is used to compute the gas flow and temperature profiles in the reactor. The increase of the H2 concentration and the decrease of TMS concentration close to the surface reveals that gas-phase pyrolysis of TMS occurs within a fewmillimeters from the hot surface. The gas composition at the outlet of the reactor is analyzed by mass spectrometry and IR absorption spectroscopy. The global gas conversion and material balance between deposited SIC, powders, and exhaust gases is obtained. Si atoms of TMS molecules are mostly converted into solid Sic and powders. In the gaseous products a small fraction of trimethylsilane SiH(CH3)3 is detected. Other gases in decreasing order of importance are H? CH,, C2H4, and C2H2. These results are compared with predictions of some thermodynamic models and chemical mechanisms reported in the literature.}

We observe a gap between the temperature of the hot surface and that of the nearby gas. This temperature gap is predicted using an accommodation coefficient which ranges from 0.15 for H2 on a graphite surface to 0.05 on a SiC surface. The measurements show a quite different behavior with H2 and N2. With the latter, a non-Boltzmann rotational population distribution is observed at a distance of one mean free path from the surface.

Different measurements were performed to investigate the noise performance of the pendulum. The results are presented and analyzed.

  abstract = {An effective single-band Hamiltonian representing a crystal electron in a uniform magnetic field is constructed from the tight-binding form of a Bloch band by replacing \$\textbackslash hbar \textbackslash veck\$ by the operator \$\textbackslash vecp-e\textbackslash vecA/c\$. The resultant Schr\"odinger equation becomes a finite-difference equation whose eigenvalues can be computed by a matrix method. The magnetic flux which passes through a lattice cell, divided by a flux quantum, yields a dimensionless parameter whose rationality or irrationality highly influences the nature of the computed spectrum. The graph of the spectrum over a wide range of "rational" fields is plotted. A recursive structure is discovered in the graph, which enables a number of theorems to be proven, bearing particularly on the question of continuity. The recursive structure is not unlike that predicted by Azbel', using a continued fraction for the dimensionless parameter. An iterative algorithm for deriving the clustering pattern of the magnetic subbands is given, which follows from the recursive structure. From this algorithm, the nature of the spectrum at an "irrational" field can be deduced; it is seen to be an uncountable but measure-zero set of points (a Cantor set). Despite these-features, it is shown that the graph is continuous as the magnetic field varies. It is also shown how a spectrum with simplified properties can be derived from the rigorously derived spectrum, by introducing a spread in the field values. This spectrum satisfies all the intuitively desirable properties of a spectrum. The spectrum here presented is shown to agree with that predicted by A. Rauh in a completely different model for crystal electrons in a magnetic field. A new type of magnetic "superlattice" is introduced, constructed so that its unit cell intercepts precisely one quantum of flux. It is shown that this cell represents the periodicity of solutions of the difference equation. It is also shown how this superlattice allows the determination of the wave function at nonlattice sites. Evidence is offered that the wave functions belonging to irrational fields are everywhere defined and are continuous in this model, whereas those belonging to rational fields are only defined on a discrete set of points. A method for investigating these predictions experimentally is sketched.}

The plasma density in argon is 93109 cm23 (620 \%) at an applied rf voltage of 250 V (500 V peak to peak) and a gas pressure of 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr). The electron density scales linearly with applied voltage. The plasma to ground sheath resistance is shown to be very important with a value of 810 V in argon at a pressure of 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr) and discharge current of 0.1 A. The value of plasma to ground resistance scales inversely with discharge current and sublinear with pressure. Two standard features in the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) have been proposed as a test of the ability of a probe system to resolve features, first, the transition from a low temperature ({$<$}1 eV) bi-Maxwellian distribution to a Druyveysten distribution (3 eV) at 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr) in argon, and the "hole" in the EEDF at 2 eV to 4 eV in nitrogen plasmas.}

But the charge, even on conducting spheres and at zero flow, is not well represented by using the standard expression for capacitance. Insulating spheres become asymmetrically charged because of ion collection asymmetry, and their total (negative) charge is considerably increased by flow. The collection flux asymmetry is documented for both conducting and insulating spheres and is not greatly different between them. The drag force upon the sphere is obtained from the code calculations. It shows reasonable agreement with appropriate analytic approximations. However, numerical discrepancies up to 20\% are found, which are attributed to uncertainties in the analytical values.}

The saturated state is then that the particle rotates at a fraction of the ion plasma frequency. However, for the conditions of many experiments, intuition is incorrect, and the direction of charge asymmetry is such as to yield stability.}

It is found that for dust separations larger than the shielding length the dust parameters for the two dust particles match with the single particle values. As the dust separation is equal to or less than the shielding length, the transverse component of ion force increases which is due to dynamic shielding effect caused by neighboring dust particle. However, dust charge, potential, and ion drag are found not to be affected considerably. Further, dust charge and potential on an arrangement of nine dust particles are computed. The dust charge and potential do not differ much from the single particle values for the presheath. However the dust charges of multiple dust particles in the sheath are much less negative compared to the single dust case which is shown to be due to ion focusing.}

This assumption is not made in the present paper. Results for the spatial variation of average energy are close to those obtained from exact solution to the linearized Boltzmann equation.

The resulting current-voltage (J-V) curve, which is valid for all gas pressures, reduces to the proper vacuum law (J V3/2) at extremely low gas pressure and to the proper high-pressure law (J V2) at high gas pressure, while it is a mixture of the two laws for intermediate gas pressures. The importance of the ratio \textbackslash nu c / \textbackslash nu p, where \textbackslash nu c is the average value of \textbackslash nu c(C) and \textbackslash nu p is the electron-plasma frequency, is emphasized. It is shown that the current is inertia limited for \textbackslash nu c / \textbackslash nu p {$<$} 1, and is mobility limited for \textbackslash nu c / \textbackslash nu p {$>$} 1. It is shown further that mobility-limited flow divides naturally into two cases, according to whether the electrons retain the energy imparted to them by the electric field or whether this energy is given up in elastic collisions with atoms.

  abstract = {The science and technology of electric propulsion (EP) encompass a broad variety of strategies for achieving very high exhaust velocities, in order to reduce the total propellant burden and corresponding launch mass of present and future space transportation systems. These techniques group broadly into three categories: electrothermal propulsion, wherein the propellant is electrically heated, then expanded thermodynamically through a nozzle; electrostatic propulsion, wherein ionized propellant particles are accelerated through an electric field; and electromagnetic propulsion, wherein current driven through a propellant plasma interacts with an internal or external magnetic field to provide streamwise body force. Such systems can produce an order of magnitude higher range of exhaust velocities and payload mass fractions than the the most advanced chemical rockets, thereby enabling or substantially enhancing many attractive space missions. Their attainable thrust densities (thrust per unit exhaust area) are much lower, however, predicating longer flight times and more complex mission trajectories. In addition, they require space-borne electric power supplies of low specific mass and high reliability, interfaced with suitable power processing equipment. Optimization of EP systems thus involves multidimensional tradeoffs among mission objectives, propellant and power plant mass, trip time, internal and external environmental factors, and overall system reliability. An enduring international program of research and development of viable electric thrusters has been in progress for several decades, and over the past few years has lead to the increasing use of a number of EP systems on commercial and governmental spacecraft. Meanwhile, yet more advanced EP concepts have matured to high credibility for future mission applications.},

  abstract = {In a parallel-plate 13.56 MHz rf reactor energetic argon neutrals are created by charge-exchange collisions in the sheath adjacent to the powered electrode. Energetic argon neutrals are detected by sampling neutrals through a 100 ?m orifice in the cathode. Downstream the orifice neutrals are analyzed parallel to the cathode normal with a quadrupolemass spectrometer equipped with an energy filter having an angular acceptance of about 2.5\textdegree. The pressure range considered was between 5 and 50 mTorr with dc bias potentials between \$-100\$ and \$-400\$ V. The measured neutral energy distributions for low pressures and low dc bias potentials have a maximum intensity at low energies slowly decreasing toward higher energies. For higher pressures and higher dc bias potentials the energy distributions have minimal intensities at low energies, exhibit a maximum at roughly 40 eV, subsequently decreasing toward higher energies. This behavior is explained as being caused by multiple scattering of energetic neutrals in the sheath. Experimental neutral energy distributions are compared with Monte Carlo simulations. In the calculations charge exchangecollisions, elastic scattering, and multiple collisions are taken into account. Experimental and theoretical neutral energy distributions are in fairly good agreement clearly indicating that multiple scattering of neutrals in the sheath is an important mechanism determining their energy distributions.},

It features a dielectric-coated discharge channel with an anode at the channel bottom. A magnetic field is applied by periodic permanent magnets (PPMs) that is mostly axially oriented in most channel regions, with radial orientation only at spatially confined magnetic cusps resulting in low particle fluxes towards the dielectric wall. The typical length scales in the description of the HEMP-T plasma range from microscopic over mesoscopic to macroscopic. Microscopic effects are introduced, e.g., by atomic interactions and surface interactions. Mesoscopic scales appear by the gyro radius of particles in the magnetic field and the formation of a transition zone between plasmas and walls on the length scale of some Debye lengths, respectively. Large-scale macroscopic length scales are introduced, e.g., by the plume expansion and interaction with test vessel walls. For a correct description of both thruster and plume plasma, one has to solve a kinetic problem for the whole region of interest, including all significant physical processes. This review offers an overview of modeling strategies and their results for the HEMP thruster. The axisymmetric 2D3v Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulation method is used to identify the basic physics of the acceleration channel and the near-field plume region. Direct comparison with the observed plasma radiation and angular ion energy distributions, both for stationary and dynamic modes, is also presented. While good qualitative agreement with experimental data is achieved, even better agreement with experiments is necessary to predict thruster performance via numerical models in the future. The limited size of the simulation domain restricts the study of the coupled thruster-plume dynamics, which is an important aspect for the interaction of ion thruster and carrier spacecraft. Improvements in computer technology, the use of hierarchical models and the multigrid method discussed in this review can help overcome these limits and improve the quality of predictive thruster modeling.},

The energy distributions in dependence on ion beam parameters (ion energy: 0.5\textendash 1 keV; ion species: Ne, Ar, Xe) and geometrical parameters (ion incidence angle, polar emission angle, and scattering angle) are measured by means of energy-selective mass spectrometry. The presence of anisotropic effects due to direct sputtering and scattering is discussed and correlated with process parameters. The experimental results are compared to calculations based on a simple elastic binary collision model and to simulations using the Monte-Carlo code sdtrimsp. The influence of the contribution of implanted primary ions on energy distributions of sputtered and scattered particles is studied in simulations. It is found that a 10\% variation of the target composition leads to detectable but small differences in the energy distributions of scattered ions. Comparison with previously reported data for other ion/target configurations confirms the presence of similar trends and anisotropic effects: the number of high-energy sputtered ions increases with increasing energy of incident ions and decreasing scattering angle. The effect of the ion/target mass ratio is additionally investigated. Small differences are observed with the change of the primary ion species: the closer the mass ratio to unity, the higher the average energy of sputtered ions. The presence of peaks, assigned to different mechanisms of direct scattering, strongly depends on the ion/target mass ratio.}

The discussed mechanisms include heat radiation, kinetic and potential energy of charged particles and neutrals as well as enthalpy of involved chemical surface reactions. The energy and momentum of particles originating from the plasma or electrodes, respectively, influence via energy flux density (energetic aspect) and substrate temperature (thermal aspect) the surface properties of the treated substrates. The various contributions to the energy balance are given in a modular mathematical framework form and examples for an estimation of heat fluxes and numerical values of relevant coefficients for energy transfer, etc. are given. For a few examples as titanium film deposition by hollow cathode arc evaporation, silicon etching in CF4 glow discharge, plasma cleaning of contaminated metal surfaces, and magnetron sputtering of aluminum the energetic balance of substrates during plasma processing will be presented. Furthermore, the influence of the resulting substrate temperature on characteristic quantities as etching or deposition rates, layer density, microstructure, etc. will be illustrated for some examples, too.}

The ICP is heated by a pancake coil antenna, which is coupled to the plasma via a dielectric window. Particles are generated by injecting a pulse of acetylene for a few seconds into an argon plasma. Afterwards, the emission of the ICP starts to oscillate with a frequency of the order of several tens of hertz. This effect differs from an attachment instability, because the oscillation persists in the argon plasma even though argon is not an electronegative gas. It is proposed that the oscillation is linked to a periodic change of particle location in the discharge volume: if particles are close to the dielectric window, the local electron density is reduced and the inductive heating is inefficient; if the particles are located at the centre of the plasma, the electron density in front of the dielectric window can build up and the inductive heating is efficient. This is an unstable situation, because when the inductive heating is efficient the ion drag force expels particles from the centre and confines them again in front of the dielectric window. This reduces the efficiency of the inductive heating. An oscillation between two states results: (i) particles in front of the dielectric window and an inefficient inductive heating; (ii) particles at the centre of the discharge and an efficient inductive heating. The feasibility of this oscillation as a tool to monitor and to control particle sizes and densities is discussed.}

The correct choice follows from the self-consistent kinetic theory. On the other hand, the binary collision approach accounts consistently for the effects of finite grain size and grain charging. Taking these effects into account an expression for the ion drag force is obtained. Calculations are performed for a typical (exemplary) set of complex plasma parameters.

Analysis shows that the ion drag usually exceeds the electrostatic force in the limit of weak electric field. We suggest that this is the cause of the central ''void" observed in microgravity complex plasma experiments.}

The spatial coupling of microwave radiation to the plasma is a concern due to issues related to the uniformity of dissociation, electron heating, and ultimately process uniformity. To investigate these issues, a finite-difference-time-domain simulation for microwave injection and propagation has been developed, and has been incorporated as a module in the two-dimensional Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model. Results from parametric studies of N2 plasmas suggest that obtaining uniform fluxes to the substrate may require a power deposition profile that is peaked off axis. An increase in power deposition tends to reinforce nonuniformities in the ion flux profile. At higher pressures ({$>$}10 mTorr) the sensitivity of the ion flux to the substrate to the angle of the magnetic field at the substrate decreases, while the uniformity of the ion flux improves. Due to the dependence of the collision frequency on electron temperature, losses from cross-field diffusion are enhanced in both the low and high pressure regimes. Results also suggest that there is an optimal pressure for maximizing both the magnitude of the ion flux to the substrate surface and its uniformity.}

Momentum accommodation was determined experimentally for gas-surface interactions simulating in a practical way those of near-earth satellites. Throughout the ranges of gas energies and incidence angles of interest for earthconditions, two components of force were measured by means of a vacuum microbalance to determine the normal and tangential momentum-accommodation coefficients for nitrogen ions on technical-quality aluminum surfaces. For these experimental conditions, the electrodynamics of ion neutralization near the surface indicate that results for nitrogen ions should differ relatively little from those for nitrogen molecules, which comprise the largest component of momentum flux for near-earth satellites. The experimental results indicated that both normal and tangential momentum-accommodation coefficients varied widely with energy, tending to be relatively well accommodated at the higher energies, but becoming progressively less accommodated as the energy was reduced to and below that for earth-satellite speeds. Both coefficients also varied greatly with incidence angle, the normal momentum becoming less accommodated as the incidence angle became more glancing, whereas the tangential momentum generally became more fully accommodated. For each momentum coefficient, an empirical correlation function was obtained which closely approximated the experimental results over the ranges of energy and incidence angle. Most of the observed variations of momentum accommodation with energy and incidence angle were qualitatively indicated by a calculation using a three-dimensional model that simulated the target surface by a one-dimensional attractive potential and hard sphere reflectors.},

Hard carbide and nitride are formed by introducing acetylene and nitrogen, respectively, to a partial pressure around 1 \textbackslash times 10-4 Torr (1.33 \textbackslash times 10-2 Pa) mixed in argon of 7.5 \textbackslash times 10-4 Torr (0.1 Pa); hollow-cathode discharge with or without a negative bias voltage gives a sound film at a relatively low substrate temperature of 350?\textdegree C or higher. These films have high micro Vickers hardness between 1100 to 1800 and 1200 to 1600 for carbide and nitride, respectively. The carbide and the nitride films show reasonably good corrosion resistance and good adhesion to steel substrates.}

It is shown that the theory based on the relaxation of the nonequilibrium electron-ion system gives a common basis for the electronic stopping power of slow ions due to valence electrons and for the energy transfer via an electron-phonon interaction. It is found that the energy loss owing to the electron-phonon interaction bears a close relationship to the electronic stopping power, but it is greatly enhanced because of the emergence of phonon excitations and band structure. The corresponding cooling rates of the thermalizing cascade are several times greater in metals with a strong electron-ion interaction than in metals with a weak interaction. A similar conclusion holds in the intermediate region, where the ions in the thermalizing cascade are essentially free to move but band-structure effects persist. However, conduction electrons play a role in the cooling of the cascade only if the dynamics of the ions gives rise to phonons.}

  abstract = {The paper reports the first test results of a new High Efficient Multistage Plasma thruster (HEMP thruster) concept, unique by its potential for extremely low wall losses and low sputter erosion, its high thrust densities and extremely wide operational ranges. The highest thrust and thrust density (thrust per channel exit area) of 43 mN and 16.9 mN/cm{$^2$} were measured so far with demonstrator model DM3a MS2 on the thrust balance of ONERA in July 02 at 30 sccm Xe flow, 500 V and 2.88 A, respectively. This operational limit was not set by the device, but the limited test time and power supply capabilities. At the same test campaign another demonstrator model DM3a MS1-2 having a slightly lower apparent ion beam angle and delivering a thrust of 24 mN provided within the smaller operational stability range the best combination of total efficiency and specific impulse with 31\% and 1682 s, respectively, at a Xe flow of 15 sccm, an anode voltage of 550 V and an anode current of 1.16 A. For brevity, the details are not given here. A further improved version, DM3a MS1-3, was tested in Oct. 02 at IOM at Leipzig with respect to angular and energy distribution of the ion beam at one selected operating point of 8 sccm, 500 V and 0.505 A. The performed measurements provided insight into the distribution of the multistage plasma potentials and the ionisation probabilities inside the thruster channel and confirmed the ideas the HEMP thruster concept is based upon. The integration over the angular and the energy distribution resulted in a thrust value of 12 mN, a total efficiency of 38\% and an effective swallow tail beam angle of 43\textdegree. Another surprising feature of DM3a MS1-3 has been its ability to turn on and off the neutraliser cathode with practically no impact on the thruster operational characteristics and its performance. At present a new HEMP thruster layout DM6 is under test. Current measurements on DM6 MS1 performed at TED Ulm by means of an own developed thermal diagnostic indicated further significant improvements. At 14 sccm, 600 V and 1.3 A, thrust, total efficiency and specific impulse were determined to be well above 30 mN, 55 \% and 2300 s, respectively. For Xe flows up to 8sccm DM6 MS1 could be stably operated at anode voltages of up to 1800 V, providing specific impulses well above 3500 s. Also operation of DM6 MS1 required no neutraliser cathode. It is intended to confirm these thermal diagnostic results on DM6 versions in the course of thrust balance tests to be performed at ONERA in February 03 the results of which shall be presented at the conference.}

  abstract = {Nine years after the first patent and 7 years after the start of hardware development, the physical properties and functioning principles of the HEMP-thruster (Highly Efficient Multistage Plasma Thruster, HEMP-T) concept are well understood only in a small group of people directly involved in the development programs of this new, promising thruster concept. This paper therefore tries to close an informational gap within the Electric Propulsion (EP) community and to foster the understanding of the HEMP-T as an own class of ion thrusters besides Grid Ion Thrusters (GITs) and Hall Effect Thrusters (HETs). This might be especially useful at a time where HEMP-Ts observe interest from spacecraft designers1,2, mission engineers and satellite operators, caused by the HEMP-Ts operational characteristics allowing reliable, low cost and low complexity EP systems. Though being a grid less device, the HEMP-T shows like a GIT a clear separation of ionization and ion acceleration zones. Therefore, performance similarities with GITs as e.g. high specific impulse ({$>$}3000 s) and high beam power efficiency ({$>$}80\%) are found. Otherwise the HEMP-T is clearly a magnetic device. With ExB areas in the cusp zones it shows similarities to HETs. But unlike HETs, the unique cusp/mirror magnetic field topology, created by a Permanent Periodic Magnet (PPM) stack, confines the discharge plasma off the dielectric thruster channel walls and is reason for the channel erosion free operation. A detailed comparison will be presented between GIT, HET and HEMP-T, based on their respective physical properties. A power balance model of the HEMP-T is provided, showing good agreement to the observed thermal losses and their locations at thruster anode and magnetic cusp zones. The model explains the advantages of the multistage compared to a single cusp thruster concept.}

Measuring the intensity of the Rayleigh/Mie scattering of the infrared signal we found a periodicity of dust formation/vanishing (period of about 35 min in our experimental conditions). The fast disappearance of the dust from the plasma region at the end of every period is the evidence of a narrow particle size distribution, as confirmed by secondary electron micrographs of the collected powder. Characteristic infrared absorption features have their origin in absorption within the dust particles. Besides the strong presence of aliphatic hydrocarbons characteristic for amorphous hydrocarbon films, a significant amount of aromatic structures was detected. Heavy positive ions measured by ion-mass spectroscopy originate from polyacetilenic (C2nH2) and aromatic compounds. Time resolved mass spectra gave insight into the plasma response to the dust formation.}

This is an important issue in applying fluid codes to experimental, laboratory, technological and fusion plasmas. Namely, fluid codes for scrapeoff layer (SOL) region in fusion devices are applicable only up to the plasma\textendash sheath boundary (also called plasma edge or sheath entrance) and cannot be extended to the material boundaries themselves, because the sheath region is far from thermodynamic equilibrium and hence near the wall plasma can be correctly described only in terms of some kinetic model. Since, accordingly, the boundary conditions for plasma modeled in the fluid description should be defined at the plasma\textendash sheath boundary (rather than at the physical surfaces), this boundary needs to be appropriately identified. However, identifying such a boundary and calculating the hydrodynamic parameters there is a demanding task which up to now has been solved only approximately and for a limited number of plasma discharges (i.e., only for some particular particle and energy production and loss balance scenarios). In available PIC codes the ion source strength profile is usually hard-coded into program and does not change during the simulation (see e.g., Berkeley codes or BIT1). On the contrary, we have built very flexible PIC procedure enabling one to use different source strength profiles in each simulation step. In the present work we present the results obtained with the ion source strength profiles proportional to potential\textendash\textsuperscript{\^\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash Phi(x)\$}.We run simulation for cases with \textbackslash alpha = 0 and \textbackslash alpha = 1 and compare results of simulation with ``classic'' numerical results of Scheuer and Emmert (1988) [Scheuer, J.T., Emmert, G.A., 1988.

Hybrid modelling (HM) is a technique which provides many opportunities to address both fundamental physics and practical matters of equipment design. HM is a hierarchical approach in which modules addressing different physical processes on vastly disparate timescales are iteratively combined using time-slicing techniques. By compartmentalizing the physics in each module to accept given inputs and produce required outputs, different algorithms can be used to represent the same physical processes. In this manner, the algorithms best suited for the conditions of interest can be used without affecting other modules. In this paper, the basis and implementation of HM are discussed using examples from simulations of inductively coupled plasmas.}

Furthermore, these arbitrary applied waveforms can produce a number of interesting phenomena that are not present in typical single-frequency sinusoidal discharges. This electrical asymmetry effect presents emerging possibilities for the improved control of the ion energy and ion flux in these systems; parameters of vital importance to both etching and deposition applications for materials processing. With a combined research approach utilizing both experimental measurements, and particle-in-cell simulations, we review and extend recent investigations that study a particular class of TVW. The waveforms used have a pulse-type shape and are composed of a varying number of harmonic frequencies. This allows a strong self-bias to be produced, and causes most of the applied voltage to be dropped across a single sheath. Additionally, decreasing the pulse width (by increasing the number of harmonics), allows the plasma density and ion flux to be increased. Simulation and experimental results both demonstrate that this type of waveform can be used to separately control the ion flux and ion energy, while still producing a uniform plasma over large area (50 cm diameter) rf electrodes.},

By investigating the ionization and power deposition profiles, it is found that rfsheathheating is too weak to sustain the discharge, and that secondary electron acceleration within the sheath is the primary heating mechanism. Due to a capacitive voltage divider formed by the rfsheaths at each electrode, the area ratio of the powered and ground electrodes is observed to have a strong effect on the resulting discharge, and if the ground electrode area is too small, the voltage drop at the powered electrode is too low to sustain a hollow cathodedischarge.},

These equations and the tables of ?(?) for various values of ? enable, for a given cathode temperature T, the potential distribution for a given current i, or vice versa, to be computed. An approximate solution for the current is: i=[(21/2/9?)(e/m)1/2(V-Vm)3/2/(x-xm)2](1+2.66?-1/2), which reduces to the usual three halves power law equation if we neglect Vm and xm and the correction factor in ?. (b) Equilibrium condition with anode at great distance, current zero. If the only retarding field is that of the space charge, the density of charge is: ?=kT?1/[(kT)1/2+x(2?e?1)1/2]2 where ?1=i0[2?m/kT]1/2. Except near the cathode this is approximately equal to kT/2?ex2; hence ? is proportional to the absolute temperature of the cathode and inversely proportional to the square of the distance away. The potential gradient at the cathode is X1=[8??1kT/e]1/2. Equations are also given for the case where an external retarding field X? is applied. II. In the case of concentric cylindrical electrodes, the current is: i=(81/2/9)(e/m)1/2[V-Vm+1/4V0log (V/?V0)2]3/2/r, where V0 is the initial energy of the electrons expressed in volts (3kT/2e), r is the radius of the anode, and ? is a constant between 1 and 2, not yet experimentally determined. The deviations from the three halves power law are not more than one quarter as much as for parallel planes and amount to only about 3 per cent at 130 volts.}

The structures of the plasma sheath and presheath are measured by an emissive probe. The ion concentrations of the two-species in the bulk plasma are calculated from ion acoustic wave experiments. Results are compared with previous experiments of Ar\textendash He plasmas in which the argon ions were the heavier ion species. Unlike the previous results, the argon speed is slower than its own Bohm velocity near the sheath?presheath boundary in the Ar\textendash Xe plasma where argon ions are the lighter ion species.

We measured the breakdown voltage, tube current and IR intensity of these three types of lamps. The DHEL showed the lowest breakdown voltage among the three lamps and a higher tube current than that of the DL.

  abstract = {Ions experience small deflections in the vicinity of grids in accelerators and ion mirrors in time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometers. Recent experiments with an orthogonal acceleration (oa) TOF instrument have verified that the effect can significantly degrade resolution when ions approach grids at an angle deviating from 90??. The phenomenon becomes significant only when ions have components of velocity at right angles to the wires of the grids. A model is presented in this study to predict this phenomenon for parallel wire grids. The fractional energy spread of ions (calculated in the static TOF-spectrometer frame of reference) scales directly with the approach angle of ions to the grid (as measured from normal approach). The energy spread also scales with the range of angles that is a consequence of the focusing effect in each gap between the wires of the grid. The equations imply that closely spaced parallel wire grids are best for deployment in oa-TOF systems where non-zero approach angles are unavoidable. Such grids are relatively impractical to manufacture and support but rectangular repeat cell grids with relatively few wires at right angles to the source axis are shown experimentally to introduce minimal energy spread. When these grids are rotated by 90??, the resolution measured in a Q-TOF spectrometer is degraded in approximate agreement with the parallel wire model. A practical implication of this work is that grid transmissions in oa-TOF systems may be significantly increased without loss of resolution. Improvements of ?200\% (V-mode) and ?400\% (W-mode) in ion transmission were obtained in this study without compromising resolution. This was achieved with ?73\% transmission grids and greater potential improvements in transmission are being realised since this study with ?89\% transmission grids having similar geometry.}

We examine the effect of angle of ejection, both polar and azimuthal, and the nonconstant velocity during desorption due to a surface binding energy on the ionization probability.}

  abstract = {At low energies ionic collisions with atoms are largely elastic. Simple theoretical approximations to scattering cross sections, ranges and straggling are derived for power potentials, showing that the scattering is peaked in the forward direction rather than isotropic. Using an approximate universal potential of Thomas-Fermi type a natural measure of range, {$\rho$}, and of energy, {$\epsilon$}, is obtained for all ions in all substances. The corresponding range-energy curve is computed. At higher ion energies the electronic excitation becomes increasingly important. An approximate formula is given for the electronic stopping contribution, increasing proportional to ion velocity at low and moderate velocities. These results are applied in the interpretation of a few isotope effects, observed in range measurements.}

  abstract = {A relationship between the apparent secondary electron yield (\textsubscript{\textbackslash rm se}) and the oxygen coverage/oxide layer thickness on an aluminum cathode is obtained in an experiment under a controlled environment. The apparent secondary electron yield (\textsubscript{\textbackslash rm se}) is deduced from the breakdown voltage between two parallel plate electrodes in a 360 mTorr argon environment using a simple Townsend breakdown model with the assumption that the variation of the apparent secondary electron yield is dominated by the variation of the argon ion induced processes. The oxygen coverage/oxide layer thickness on the aluminum cathode is measured by a semi in situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy equipment which is directly attached to the discharge chamber. It is found that three phases exist: (1) in the monomonolayer regime, as the oxygen coverage increases from 0 to 0.3, \textsubscript{\textbackslash rm se} decreases by nearly 40\%, (2) as the oxygen coverage increases from 0.3 to 1, \textsubscript{\textbackslash rm se} keeps nearly constant, (3) as the oxide layer thickness increases from about 0.3 nm to about 1.1 nm, \textsubscript{\textbackslash rm se} increases by 150\%. We propose that, in the submonolayer regime, the chemisorbed oxygen on the aluminum surface causes the decrease of \textsubscript{\textbackslash rm se} by creating a local potential barrier, which reduces the Auger neutralization rate and the energy gained by the Auger electrons. In the multilayer regime, as the oxide layer grows in thickness, there are three proposed mechanisms which cause the increase of \textsubscript{\textbackslash rm se}: (1) the work function decreases; (2) resonance neutralization and Auger de-excitation may exist. This is served as another channel for secondary electron production; (3) the kinetic energy of Auger electrons is increased on average, leading to a higher probability for electrons to overcome the surface potential barrier.},

The electron density, electron temperature and electron energy distribution function (EEDF) are measured at different O2 contents, gas pressures and applied powers. At fixed pressure and power, the electron density first drops quickly with the O2 ratio and then tends to saturate in the high O2 ratio range. The effective electron temperature exhibits completely opposite behaviors at low and high pressures. This is caused by the different evolving behaviors of low and high energy electrons of the EEDFs with the O2 ratio. Both the Langmuir probe and the global model predict that the electron density of O2/Ar mixed plasma first increases, peaks and then drops constantly, upon increasing the pressure. An analysis based on the simulation reveals that the non-monotonic variation of electron density with the pressure is due to the non-monotonic variation of the ionizations from both ground state O and metastable O*. Due to the strong ionizations, the electron density increases linearly with the power. The effective electron temperature is unchanged because the EEDF shape that determines the electron temperature is not varied upon increasing the power. The calculated electron density and temperature when varying the power agree better with the experiments at high pressure, i.e. 45 mTorr. The quantitative deviation between the model and the experiment when varying the pressure and the O2 ratio can be explained by two aspects. (1) The electron energy probability function is assumed to have a Maxwellian distribution in the global model while the realistic EEDFs vary significantly with the pressure and/or the O2 ratio, as revealed by the experiment. (2) The power transfer efficiency (i.e. the fraction of the power coupled into plasma) increases with the pressure.}

Other than the particle size, two features in NanoFET's design also govern the range of achievable specific charges: the gate electrode configuration, which sets the charging electric fields and the resulting particle charge, and the particle mass density. Electrostatic simulations for various gate electrode configurations were conducted in COMSOL Multiphysics(R) to provide general scaling relations for the acquired particle charge as a function of gate geometry as well as particle size and proximity. The simulation results suggest that configurations with smaller gate aspect ratios, smaller relative particle sizes (compared to gate length scales), and larger extractor spacing-to-diameter ratios provide greater charging. The use of low mass density or hollow particles also enhances NanoFET's specific charge and gives the potential for moderate specific impulse and high thrust-to-power performance. Precise thrust control may also be possible using NanoFET's piezoelectric feed system to facilitate particle passage through the charging sieves, enable particle extraction, and regulate the mass flow rate.}

  abstract = {A new model of the plasma plume from Hall effect thrusters (HETs) has been developed for the purpose of more accurately predicting the interactions between future high-power thrusters and large high-voltage solar arrays, such as those being developed under NASA's Game Changing Technology awards by ATK and Deployable Space Systems. The HET plume mainly consists of two types of ions. The first are the energetic main beam ions produced upstream of the thruster acceleration zone. These are the dominant ion species along the thrust axis. The other group of ions have lower kinetic energy and are generated downstream of the acceleration zone from neutral xenon gas atoms by charge exchange (CEX) with main beam ions and by electron impact ionization. The neutral gas is due to neutral propellant atoms leaving the thruster and the hollow cathode without being ionized, and, in the case of laboratory testing, background neutrals present in the vacuum chamber. The new model uses the 2-D axisymmetric Hall thruster code, Hall2De, to self-consistently calculate the three major components of the plume in the vicinity of the thruster, which are the neutral gas atoms, high-energy beam ions, and low-energy ions. From the boundary computational region in the near plume, the Hall2De results are propagated to distances of tens of meters using a continuum hydrodynamic algorithm. This approach offers important advantages with respect to prior models of Hall thruster plumes, such as the NASA Electric Propulsion Interactions Code (EPIC), which uses an analytical fit to laboratory data from a single thruster for the main beam velocity boundary conditions at the channel exit. EPIC assumes that the neutral gas density emanates uniformly and isotropically from the channel exit. Low-energy ions are generated only by CEX; low-energy ions generated by electron impact are not included. The results for the far-field plume of a conceptual high-power thruster (H6) show important differences between EPIC and simulations using the new plume model. High-energy ions undergo less expansion in the azimuthal direction than in EPIC. This can be attributed to magnetic focusing of the beam. We also observe that the peak in low-energy ion density at approximately 90\textdegree{} from the thrust axis predicted by EPIC is moved downstream to angles from 70\textdegree{} to 80\textdegree{} when the new plume model is employed.}

An exhaustive study of the literature has been performed to identify what were the reasons behind the disappearance of Colloid Thrusters. Apart from programmatic reasons related to the introduction of the Space Shuttle, some technical reasons where identified. The technical difficulties had to do with the use of arrays of needles. Aiming at overcoming these difficulties, an alternative way to construct Colloid Thrusters has been proposed. Instead of needles, holes in Teflon where used. This has been tested both numerically and experimentally with positive results. This development may be useful not only for colloid propulsion but also for other technologies that require electrospray emission.},

The experiment was performed in a direct-current gas discharge of cylindrical geometry with applied radial electric field and axial magnetic field. The unmagnetized plasma ions, neutralized by magnetized electrons, were accelerated radially outward transferring part of the gained momentum to neutrals. Measurements were taken for various argon gas flow rates between 13 and 100 Standard Cubic Centimeter per Minute, for a discharge current of 1.9 A and a magnetic field intensity of 136 G. The plasma density, electron temperature, and plasma potential were measured at various locations along the flow. These measurements were used to determine the local electric force on the ions. The total electric force on the plasma ions was then determined by integrating radially the local electric force. In parallel, the momentum flux of the mixed ion-neutral flow was determined by measuring the force exerted by the flow on a balance force meter (BFM). The maximal plasma density was between \textsuperscript{10\$}?cm\textsuperscript{-3\$} and \textsuperscript{11\$} cm\textsuperscript{-3\$}, the maximal electron temperature was between 8 eV and 25 eV, and the deduced maximal electric field was between 2200 V/m and 5800 V/m.

The ratio of force over power is found for the three gases, while the gas flow rates and magnetic field intensities are varied over a wide range of values, resulting in a wide range of gas pressures and applied voltages.

The configuration, coined a radial plasma source, consists of two ceramic disks positioned parallel to each other, between which a cylindrical molybdenum anode is mounted. The electric field is generated by applying a voltage between the anode and a heated cathode neutralizer that is located away from the ceramic disks. The plasma diagnostic system includes Langmuir probes, an emissive probe, and a balance force meter. The discharge voltage is found to increase when the magnetic field is increased or when the mass flow rate  and the pressure  is decreased. For a discharge current of 1.4 A, the discharge voltage increases from 55 to 120 V when the magnetic field is increased from 0 to 186 G. The azimuthal uniformity of the plasma flow is found to decrease with the increase in gas pressure. The force exerted on the balance force meter is found to be larger than the force exerted by the plasma flow. This disparity indicates that a considerable part of the force is exerted by the neutral gas, which has gained momentum from the plasma via ion-neutral collisions. The force is increased because the momentum delivered for a given deposited power is larger if the energy is deposited in a larger mass, as happens here through plasma collisions. We estimate theoretically the expected force at the collisionless and the collisional limits and find that the measured force is between the expected forces at the two limits.}

The measured heat flux into the negatively biased probe is in good agreement with the calculated heat flux carried by the impinging plasma ions.},

A unique combination of rotating spacecraft, amplitude-triggered high-cadence waveform collection, and electric field antenna configuration allow the first direct determination of dust impact direction by any spacecraft using electric field data. Dust flux and impact direction data indicate that the observed dust is approximately micron-sized with both interplanetary and interstellar populations. Nanometer radius dust is not detected by Wind during times when nanometer dust is observed on the STEREO spacecraft and both spacecraft are in close proximity. Determined impact directions suggest that interplanetary dust detected by Wind/WAVES at 1 AU is dominated by particles on bound trajectories crossing Earth's orbit, rather than dust with hyperbolic orbits.},

The calculations for the ions are performed using a Monte Carlo method that includes charge exchange and elasticscattering. The contribution of both collision processes to the angular ion impact energy distribution is studied. For the case that charge exchange is the only collision process, the Monte Carlo results can be checked against those of a method based on a spatially uniform and time independent collision rate. In that case, both methods yield the same ion impact energy distribution. The position, velocity, and propagation angle of the energetic neutrals created in collisions of ions with the background gas are stored. These are used as input data for a separate code that follows the evolution of the angular neutral energy distribution, taking into account (multiple) neutral elasticscattering. From the ion and neutral distributions, the number of neutrals per ion, the average impact energy, and the energy-weighted average impact angle have been derived. It is shown that these parameters are well described by simple expressions. Finally, the sputter yield is calculated. The results show that the contribution of the angular distributions of both ions and neutrals to the yield can be neglected.},

The ion impact energy distribution consists of a collision-free part and a collision-induced part. It is observed that in Ar, N2, O2, and Cl2 the collision?induced part contains single and double peaks at regular energy intervals. This peaked structure is attributed to charge exchange processes in the sheath. Both the collision-free part and the collision?induced part of the ion impact energy distribution are well described by a model based on a constant sheath width, a sinusoidal sheath voltage, and a power law for the electric field in the sheath. The only adjustable parameter in the model is the sheath thickness. The sheath thickness has also been determined independently from the total ion current density using the Child\textendash Langmuir law. The obtained values are in good quantitative agreement with each other and with the observed optical sheath thickness, demonstrating the overall consistency of the present approach.}

Aluminum samples were exposed to quantified beams of argon ions up to 2000 eV and to oxygen atoms and molecules in order to mimic the plasma-surface interactions on metallic targets during reactive sputtering. The variation of electron emission yield was correlated to the ion energy and to the oxidation state of Al surfaces.

Four FEEP emitters with three different slit height values were tested. Thrust produced covered the 1\textendash 170 mN range. Repeatability of thruster performance was found to depend on the degree of wetting of the emitter slit and on the presence of glow discharge between the electrodes. The latter represented an undesired effect and was therefore eliminated after the . rst series of experiments. Wetting, on the contrary, proved to be of the utmost importance. In some cases, thruster performance improved by up to as much as 150\% within a few days of the beginning of the test, as a result of enhanced slit wetting.}

This mixed composition provides the first direct evidence for a clumpy density structure of the grain-forming region.

Depending on the choice of continuum, a range of mass fractions is observed for periclase ranging from 2.7\% +- 1.7\% in the most conservative case to 9\% +- 2\% in a less-constrained continuum. In addition, we identify a feature at 11.2 mm as the crystalline silicate forsterite, with only a minor contribution from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Electric thrusters, also termed ion or plasma thrusters, deliver a low thrust level compared to their chemical counterparts, but they offer significant advantages for in-space propulsion as energy is uncoupled to the propellant, therefore allowing for large energy densities. Although the development of EP goes back to the 1960s, the technology potential has just begun to be fully exploited because of the increase in the available power aboard spacecraft, as demonstrated by the very recent appearance of all-electric communication satellites. This article first describes the fundamentals of EP: momentum conservation and the ideal rocket equation, specific impulse and thrust, figures of merit and a comparison with chemical propulsion. Subsequently, the influence of the power source type and characteristics on the mission profile is discussed. Plasma thrusters are classically grouped into three categories according to the thrust generation process: electrothermal, electrostatic and electromagnetic devices. The three groups, along with the associated plasma discharge and energy transfer mechanisms, are presented via a discussion of long-standing technologies like arcjet thrusters, magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters, pulsed plasma thrusters and ion engines, as well as Hall thrusters and variants. More advanced concepts and new approaches for performance improvement are discussed afterwards: magnetic shielding and wall-less configurations, negative ion thrusters and plasma acceleration with a magnetic nozzle. Finally, various alternative propellant options are analyzed and possible research paths for the near future are examined.},

The distribution remains essentially isotropic as the ions are accelerated through the presheath to satisfy the Bohm criterion. At intermediate pressures (around 10mTorr), ion-neutral collisions scatter a significant part of the ion kinetic energy from the parallel direction to the perpendicular direction, leading to a net heating of the ions. In addition, the ion velocity distribution becomes distinctly anisotropic.

  abstract = {Langmuir probe measurements were performed in connection with optical emission spectroscopy to study the alpha to gamma transition in a symmetric radiofrequency (f=13.56 MHz) discharge between parallel plates in helium. The measurements were carried out over a wide range of pressures (30-300 Pa) and discharge voltages (20-400 V). The correlation between these two diagnostic methods is investigated. The alpha to gamma transition can be seen in the sudden change both in the measured electron-energy distribution function and in the line intensities with increasing discharge voltage. The observed dramatic lowering of the electron temperature in the gamma mode (the secondary-electron-dominated mode) results in extreme differences in the optical emission between singlet and triplet helium lines due to spin-changing collisions of electrons and metastable atoms. It is deduced, using two different electrode materials (aluminium and stainless steel), that secondary electrons and metastable atoms play the dominant role in the formation of the two discharge modes. Furthermore, the probe measurement data are shown to be in very good agreement with those recently reported by Godyak et al. (1992).},

Morphological investigations of the surface of polycrystalline beryllium after several implantation and annealing cycles show a strong dependence of the damage on the surface orientation of grains. This dependence correlates with the preferred diffusion of interstitials parallel to basal planes of the beryllium lattice as calculated within the formalism of density functional theory.},

The important role played by atomic oxygen adsorbed on satellite surfaces has been revealed by the analysis of data from orbiting mass spectrometers and pressure gauges. Data from satellites of special design have yielded information on the energy accommodation and angular distributions of molecules reemitted from satellite surfaces. Consequently, it is now possible to calculate satellite drag coefficients from basic physical principles, utilizing parameters of gas\textendash surface interactions measured in orbit. The results of such calculations are given. They show the drag coefficients of four satellites of different compact shapes in low-earth orbit with perigee altitudes in the range from about 150 to 300 km, where energy accommodation coefficients and diffuse angular distributions have been measured. The calculations are based on Sentman's analysis of drag forces in free-molecular flow. His model incorporates the random thermal motion of the incident molecules, and assumes that all molecules are diffusely reemitted The uncertainty caused by the assumption of diffuse reemission is estimated by using Schamberg's model of gas\textendash surface interaction, which can take into account a quasi-specular component of the reemission. Such a quasi-specular component is likely to become more important at higher altitudes as the amount of adsorbed atomic oxygen decreases. A method of deducing accommodation coefficients and angular distributions at higher altitudes by comparing the simultaneous orbital decay of satellites of different shapes at a number of altitudes is suggested. The purpose is to improve thermospheric measurements and models, which are significantly affected by the choice of drag coefficients.},

Velocities were measured both parallel and perpendicular to the wafer over an energy range of 0.4\textendash 600?eV.

Several cm above the wafer the IVD is Maxwellian and independent of phase. Experimental results were compared with simulations.

The laser is phase locked to the LF bias and IVD measurements are taken at several different LF phases. Ion energy distribution (IED) function measurements and calculated moments are compared for several cases. IEDs were measured at two disparate phases of the phase-locked LF bias. IEDs were found to be multipeaked and were well-approximated by a sum of Maxwellian distributions. The calculated fluxes in the dual frequency case were found to be substantially more radially uniform than the single frequency bias case. For industrial applications, this radially uniform ion flux is evidently a trade off with the undesirable multipeaked structure in the IEDs.}

A two-dimensional, free boundary fluid code, RIPPLE, was modified to account for this flux and used to give an initial estimate of the seriousness of this effect. Lithium films are dramatically affected, to such a degree that their use in an LM divertor is seriously questioned. Gallium films withstand the momentum flux much better, with speeds of around 1 m s-1 giving adequate performance in a realistic CDA divertor momentum flux profile.

Ar+ ions with impact energies ranging from 65 to 1030 eV were used as bombarding species. The experimental data were recorded with a secondary-neutral mass spectrometer that combines electron-gas post-ionization with a high-transmission double focusing mass spectrometer. Due to the instrument's high detection sensitivity, the energy spectra could be determined over a large intensity range, covering up to five orders of magnitude. A comparable (or even) larger emission-energy range could be monitored in the computer simulations which were done with the dynamic TRIDYN code. The computed energy spectra are in qualitative agreement with the corresponding experimental distributions. Not surprisingly, the data from both approaches indicate that the inverse-square emission-energy dependence of the yield predicted by analytical sputtering theory is generally not valid for the low (near-threshold) impact energies used in this work and for emission energies approaching the maximum possible values. Rather, the energy spectra exhibit, over a considerable energy range, an exponentially decreasing yield with increasing emission energy. The large range of emission energies detected provided the opportunity to derive estimates of the maximum emission energy and its dependence on the primary-ion energy E for the various atomic species. These values amount to 0.55E for Cu and Ni atoms and to 0.35E for W atoms sputtered from the alloys and to 0.6E for Cu atoms sputtered from the pure Cu specimen; they are compared to simple estimates of the maximum emission energies in low-energy sputtering based on collision sequences leading to the ejection events that involve only a small number of atoms.}

That study showed that such a system was capable of producing a high electron flux and relatively low ion and neutral temperatures. About 40 years later, the work of Lidsky and others showed that hollow cathode arc discharges were one of the best plasmas sources available at that time. The term "hollow cathode discharges" has commonly been used in reference to almost any discharge in a cathode with a cavity-like geometry, such that the plasma was enclosed or partially bound by the electrode walls that were at the cathode potential. Just as the magnetic field trapping of the electrons in a magnetron cathode results in an increase in the plasma density, in the hollow cathode, the reduced electron loss due to the geometry of the cathode also results in a higher plasma density. At least three types of discharge can be established in a hollow cathode. At low power and/or at relatively low gas pressures, the plasma is a "conventional" discharge characterized by low currents and medium to high voltages (we will call this a discharge in a hollow cathode or D-HC). Even this type of plasma has a higher density than a normal planar parallel-plate or magnetron system because the hollow geometry strongly reduces the loss of electrons. Using an adequate combination of gas pressure and applied power with a given hollow cathode diameter, or separation of the cathode surface, the negative glow of the plasma can expand to occupy the majority of the interior volume of the cathode. Under this condition the plasma current can, for the same voltage, be 100 to 1000 times the value of the "simple" D-HC discharge, and the plasma density is correspondingly larger (we call this a hollow cathode discharge or HCD). If the cathode is not cooled, the discharge can transform into a dispersed arc as the electrode temperature increases and thermal-field electron emission becomes an important additional source of electrons (we will call this a hollow cathode arc or HCA). The accepted explanation for the HCD phenomenon involves the existence of high-energy "pendulum" electrons, which are reflected from the sheaths on either side of the cathode; the long trajectory of this electron is understood to produce a large number of secondary electrons, with this resulting in the high plasma density and plasma current. We describe the structure of a parallel-plate discharge, particularly the gas phase and cathode surface excitation and ionization collision processes. Using this description, we discuss some of the problems associated with the conventional hollow cathode model and we propose a new explanation that has important implications for the physics and applications of hollow cathodes. In the last section of this review, we describe how hollow cathodes have and can be used to deposit thin films and nanostructured coatings. We provide an extensive and approximately chronological listing of how hollow cathodes have been successfully used to deposit materials, mainly by sputtering and plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition based techniques.},

Increasing the particles' charge-to-mass ratios is critical for maximizing their velocities when accelerated with applied electric fields, which requires minimizing the particles' sizes down to the micro- and nanometer ranges for some applications. An analysis reveals that the charge-to-mass ratio is maximized with low aspect ratio particles when the maximum electric field strength, which is at the top of the particles, is held constant. Experimental results of charging titanium and aluminum spherical and cylindrical particles are presented, which suggest that under appropriate conditions, the particles are charged as predicted by theory. But that electrical contact resistance between the particles and electrode can influence the charging time.

  abstract = {A new electrostatic propulsion system that utilizes micro- and nano-particles is under development. At its core, multi-layer grids establish electric fields that charge and accelerate the particles. Before charging, the particles are transported to charging/accelerating zones from storage reservoirs. One method of transport delivers the particles suspended in liquid through microfluidic channels. Another method transports the particles through micro-sieves as a dry powder. Advantages over current technologies include the ability to tune its operational parameters over a large range, elimination of life-limiting characteristics, and increased design flexibility. Note that other applications such as materials processing and nanoprinting may also benefit from emitted high-energy particles. This thesis investigates several limiting obstacles, which are associated with charging particles, extracting particles from liquids, and overcoming adhesion/cohesion of particles. The results provide new direction towards the final thruster design concept. Here, the obstacles under discussion include: - The ability to accurately charge the particles and to maximize their charge-to-mass ratios is investigated. Theoretical analyses and simulations suggest that restricting the maximum electric field at the particles' surfaces is a necessary condition to avoid breakdown or field emission. With this constraint, spheres obtain greater charge-tomass ratios than cylinders because they more uniformly distribute charge over their surfaces. Experimental results suggest that the charging models are reasonable under appropriate conditions. - When transporting particles in a liquid suspension, the ability to extract them with an electric force while preventing the liquid from becoming unstable is critical. Theoretical modeling and experimentation prove that both spherical and cylindrical particles can be extracted successfully. But, it may not be possible to extract particles smaller than the micron range without inducing an instability, which leads to the formation of Taylor cones and limits thruster performance. - When transporting and emitting dry particles, preventing particle adhesion/cohesion is important. Theoretical models developed here, which are supported by experimental results, suggest that an electric force can be use to overcome the adhesion of particles in the nanometer range. A functional micro-sieve thruster prototype capable of operating continuously has demonstrated the ability to overcome adhesion/cohesion in the micron range.},

This prototype was designed to further the understanding of the physics governing the nanoparticle Field Extraction Thruster (nanoFET) concept. The nanoFET concept proposes an electric propulsion approach that can have a highly adjustable charge-to-mass ratio and electrostatic acceleration that potentially could span a specific impulse range from 100 s to 10,000 s and thrust power ranging from microwatts to many tens of kilowatts at high efficiency. Here, we present experimental results from spherical and cylindrical particle extraction tests from an insulating liquid. Using the prototype, we have successfully demonstrated the extraction of particles with diameters as small as a few tens of microns. In addition, this paper investigates potential issues with the first generation prototype and makes suggestions for the development of future generations.}

  abstract = {This paper introduces a nanoparticle field extraction thruster (nanoFET) concept that does not depend on the liquid delivery of micro and nano-particles for extraction and acceleration. The no-liquid approach potentially provides important advantages such as allowing the use of smaller particles for propellant, which may offer a greater specific impulse. The most likely developmental obstacles are the adhesion of the particles to the source electrode and the cohesion between the particles. Adhesion and cohesion models are presented along with proposed methods of overcoming each. A method of using the applied charging electric field to overcome the adhesion force is investigated, which predicts that it may be possible to remove particles with diameters down to hundreds or even tens of nanometers from a planar electrode with only the application of a high strength electric field. To investigate this particle removal model, eight test cases, involving 4 particle sizes and 2 electrode materials, are presented. A method of transporting the dry particle propellant through an ultra-fine sieve prior to the charging and accelerating stages is investigated as a method of overcoming the cohesion between the particles. A simple proof-of-concept experiment is presented which indicates that this method is capable of breaking the cohesion force under appropriate conditions, which helps to guide future research.}

  abstract = {A simple, compact cantilever force probe (CFP) has been developed for plasma pressure measurements. It is based on the pull-in phenomenon well known in microelectromechanical-system electrostatic actuators. The probe consists of a thin (25?{$\mu$}m) titanium foil cantilever (38 mm of length and 14 mm of width) and a fixed electrode separated by a 0.75 mm gap. The probe is shielded by brass box and enclosed into boron nitride housing with a 9 mm diameter window for exposing part of cantilever surface to the plasma. When the voltage is applied between the cantilever and the electrode, an attractive electrostatic force is counterbalanced by cantilever restoring spring force. At some threshold (pull-in) voltage the system becomes unstable and the cantilever abruptly pulls toward the fixed electrode until breakdown occurs between them. The threshold voltage is sensitive to an additional externally applied force, while a simple detection of breakdown occurrence can be used to measure that threshold voltage value. The sensitivity to externally applied forces obtained during calibration is 0.28 V/{$\mu$}N (17.8?V/Pa for pressure). However, the resolution of the measurements is \$\textbackslash pm0.014\$ mN (\$\textbackslash pm0.22\$ Pa) due to the statistical scattering in measured pull-in voltages. The diagnostic temporal resolution is 10?ms, being determined by the dynamics of pull-in process. The probe has been tested in the tokamak ISTTOK edge plasma, and a plasma force of 0.07?mN (plasma pressure 1.1 Pa) has been obtained near the leading edge of the limiter. This value is in a reasonable agreement with the estimations using local plasma parameters measured by electrical probes. The use of the described CFP is limited by a heat flux of Q 10\^6 W/m\^2 due to uncontrollable rise of the cantilever temperature (\$\textbackslash Delta T\$ 20 \textdegree C) during CFP response time.}

The effects of particle size and particle morphology on in-flight particle velocity and deposition efficiency were investigated. The critical velocity of copper powder was estimated by combining the in-flight particle velocity and deposition efficiency. The effect of annealing of feedstock powder on deposition and critical velocity was also investigated. The results showed that the irregular shape particle presents higher in-flight velocity than the spherical shape particle under the same condition. For irregular shape particles, the in-flight velocity decreased from 390 to 282 m/s as the particle size increases from 20 to 60 mm. Critical velocities of about 425 m/s and more than 550 m/s were estimated for the feedstock copper powder with spherical and irregular shape morphology, respectively. For the irregular shape particles, the critical velocity decreased from more than 550 to 460 m/s after preheating at 390 \textdegree C for 1 h.

Plasma density decay times measured using both the mass resolved energy analyser and a Langmuir probe are in good agreement.

They are in agreement with the experiments showing an ``under-cosine'' distribution (peaked at \th eta = 45\textdegree\textendash 60\textdegree ) for the lower energies which evolves towards a cosine distribution as the incident ion energy increases.}

  abstract = {Both an energy balance equation and a collisional-radiative model were developed in order to discover which process is responsible for gas heating in a low-pressure argon discharge. In this way, for a wide range of plasma conditions, the space-charge field contribution to gas heating was found to be negligible compared to that resulting from elastic collisional processes, although the value of the former is higher than the latter when calculating the absorbed power per electron. This is due to (1) the heating associated with the space-charge field only being effective in the plasma sheath, which is very close to the vessel inner wall. (2) The vessel temperature value at the external wall is taken as a boundary condition, as a result of which the space-charge field influence on gas heating is indirectly imposed on the model. The results of the collisional-radiative model take into account the influence of gas heating on the electron temperature and on the argon low-lying excited levels. Two different zones have been found. The first corresponds to low electron densities, in which the gas temperature remains constant, whereas in the second (high electron densities) the heating of the gas takes on great importance. These results compare well with experimental data.},

  abstract = {Dust grains immersed into a low-temperature plasma are charged negatively because the electron attachment dominates other charging processes. However, increasing energy of impinging electrons leads to the increase of the yield of secondary emission. When this yield exceeds unity, the grain becomes charged positively. Previous laboratory experiments with electron beams have shown that the surface potential of large grains follows roughly an energy dependence of the secondary emission yield. It means that the grain potential reaches its maximum for hundreds of electronvolts of electron energy and then decreases. Model calculations reveal that the decrease of the grain potential with the electron energy can lead to the reversal of charge sign in a certain range of grain diameters. After this reversal, the grain is charged to the negative potential close to the beam energy. We use of this effect for investigations of electron field emission from nonconducting spheres (glass and melamine formaldehyde resin) with the diameter 4\textendash 11 \textbackslash mum for glass and 5 and 10 \textbackslash mum for resin. Single grains were trapped in a Paul trap and bombarded by the electron beam. The beam energy was changed in a range of 0.3\textendash 10 keV. The experimental results confirm the aforementioned expectations and an analysis of these results has shown that: 1) the effective work function for electron field emission from charged nonconducting materials (glass and melamine resin) could be as low as 2 eV, but it can be close to 5 eV as expected for insulating materials. The difference is connected with the charging history. 2) The effect of field dependent secondary emission limits the attainable negative potential.}

Charging processes of dust in space and their influence on the dust dynamics are analyzed in laboratory simulations of secondary emission, field ion and electron emissions, and dust sputtering. Single micrometre-sized grains and grain clusters are stored in a hyperbolic quadrupole field under ultra-high vacuum conditions for long time periods. The charge state of the grain and its evolution are recorded while the grain is exposed to ion or electron beams of various energies and fluxes. The influence of the secondary electron emission on the charge state is measured and compared with a computer model. Limitations on the grain charge by the field electron and ion emission are considered next. The measurements allow analyzing field emission from conductive and dielectric grains. The existence of long-lived surface states on insulating materials, which are probably responsible for the anomalous behavior of field electron emission and the low threshold of the field ion emission, is indicated. The observation of sputtering by energetic ions showing a surprising anisotropic erosion of a conductive grain is analyzed. The sputtering and the field ion emission are discussed as possible sources of the so-called pick-up ions.}

In the laboratory, only the beam experiments would fulfill these conditions; however, in the space, ions of these energies can be found even in the solar wind. It was suggested that the sputtering is one of the most important destruction processes of micrometer-sized dust grains, and on the other hand, it would be a source of heavy species in the interplanetary medium. We simulate the space environment by trapping the dust grains in an electrodynamic quadrupole trap and by influencing them by the ion beam with a variable energy up to 5 keV. The grains are charged to high surface potentials, and thus, a strong electric field near the surface can affect the sputtering rate. The finite size and the small curvature radius of grains play an important role in the quantification of sputtering efficiency. We propose a simple sputtering model for spherical grains and compare its predictions with measurements. An interpretation of the preliminary results obtained on gold microspheres bombarded by argon ions indicates that not only the grain mass but also the grain shape is changing in the course of our experiment. We suggest that similar effects can occur in the space if the dust is exposed to collimated ion beams.}

The yields of electrons per ion, fast atom and photon vary greatly with particle energy and surface condition. Then models of electron, ion, fast atom, excited atom and photon transport and kinetics are fitted to electrical-breakdown and low-current, discharge-maintenance data to determine the contributions of various cathode-directed species to the secondary electron production. Our model explains measured breakdown and low-current discharge voltages for Ar over a very wide range of electric field to gas density ratios \$E/n\$ i.e. 15 Td to 100 kTd.

Extensive tables compare our entire database to the NRLMSISE-00, MSISE-90, and Jacchia-70 models for different altitude bands and levels of geomagnetic activity. We also explore scientific issues related to the new data sets in the NRLMSIS database. Especially noteworthy is the solar activity dependence of the Jacchia data, with which we study a large O+ contribution to the total mass density under the combination of summer, low solar activity, high latitude, and high altitude. Under these conditions, except at very low solar activity, the Jacchia data and the Jacchia-70 model indeed show a significantly higher total mass density than does MSISE-90. However, under the corresponding winter conditions, the MSIS-class models represent a noticeable improvement relative to Jacchia-70 over a wide range of F10.7. Considering the two regimes together, NRLMSISE-00 achieves an improvement over both MSISE-90 and Jacchia-70 by incorporating advantages of each.},

  abstract = {An electric propulsion thrust stand capable of supporting testing of thrusters having a total mass of up to 125kg and producing thrust levels between 100 {$\mu$}N to 1N has been developed and tested. The design features a conventional hanging pendulum arm attached to a balance mechanism that converts horizontal deflections produced by the operating thruster into amplified vertical motion of a secondary arm. The level of amplification is changed through adjustment of the location of one of the pivot points linking the system. Response of the system depends on the relative magnitudes of the restoring moments applied by the displaced thruster mass and the twisting torsional pivots connecting the members of the balance mechanism. Displacement is measured using a noncontact, optical linear gap displacement transducer, and balance oscillatory motion is attenuated using a passive, eddy-current damper. The thrust stand employs an automated leveling and thermal control system. Pools of liquid gallium are used to deliver power to the thruster without using solid wire connections, which can exert undesirable time-varying forces on the balance. These systems serve to eliminate sources of "zero drift" that can occur as the stand thermally or mechanically shifts during the course of an experiment. An in situcalibration rig allows for steady-state calibration before, during, and after thruster operation. Thrust measurements were carried out on a cylindrical Hall thruster that produces millinewton-level thrust. The measurements were very repeatable, producing results that compare favorably with previously published performance data, but with considerably smaller uncertainty.},

In particular, we have found that the radiation emitted by sputtered alkali atoms extends to surprisingly large distances from the electron bombarded surface of alkali halides. The results are discussed in terms of the relevant sputtering mechanisms responsible for alkali halide erosion. It is suggested that the atomic excitation of ion sputtered particles takes place at the surface in the final collision of the cascade, while most of the observed radiation in the case of electron bombardment originates in gas-phase collisions above the surface.}

The harnesses consisted of three different space-grade cable types: power cables, screened twisted pair data cables and radio frequency (RF) cables. They were alternately shielded by two different types of representative spacecraft structure walls. Ten hypervelocity impact (HVI) tests at 0\textdegree{} incidence have been performed with impact velocities ranging from 6.4 km/s to 7.7 km/s. Projectiles have been aluminium spheres with diameters ranging from 1.5 mm to 4.0 mm. During the tests, all cables were operated at their representative conditions and the disturbances, induced by the impacts, were measured. The malfunction observed could be related to two physical failure mechanisms: (1) short circuits caused by a conducting cloud of molten and evaporated aluminium and, for the data cables, (2) strands being bent by impacting fragments creating a short circuit between screen and signal cable. The influence of a more complex structure wall to the failure mechanism in (1) is shown. Malfunction was dependent on mechanical damage, but no clear correlation between severity of malfunction and mechanical damage could be established. The data cables were the most vulnerable cable, while the RF cables were the most robust. The disturbances recorded could pose a significant threat to connected electronic equipment. Examples of electrical performance are given.}

Inside the hollow cathode the energy influx is nearly constant along the whole cathode length. With increasing pressure the energy influx decreased.

For efficient propellant usage, electric propulsion systems based on the electrostatic acceleration of ions formed during electron impact ionization of a gas are particularly attractive [5,6]. At present, xenon is used almost exclusively as an ionizable propellant for space propulsion [2,3,4,5]. However, xenon is rare, it must be stored under high pressure and commercial production is expensive [7,8,9]. Here we demonstrate a propulsion system that uses iodine propellant and we present in-orbit results of this new technology. Diatomic iodine is stored as a solid and sublimated at low temperatures. A plasma is then produced with a radio-frequency inductive antenna, and we show that the ionization efficiency is enhanced compared with xenon. Both atomic and molecular iodine ions are accelerated by high-voltage grids to generate thrust, and a highly collimated beam can be produced with substantial iodine dissociation. The propulsion system has been successfully operated in space onboard a small satellite with manoeuvres confirmed using satellite tracking data. We anticipate that these results will accelerate the adoption of alternative propellants within the space industry and demonstrate the potential of iodine for a wide range of space missions. For example, iodine enables substantial system miniaturization and simplification, which provides small satellites and satellite constellations with new capabilities for deployment, collision avoidance, end-of-life disposal and space exploration [10,11,12,13,14].}

The approximations used are more restrictive in this calculation, the calculations being only semiquantitative in nature. The cross section of an asymmetric charge exchange process is determined in terms of the \$\textbackslash Delta E\$ of the reaction and the ``average'' ionization potential of the two atoms.

A new method was devised for obtaining absolute cross sections of gases relative to H2, and a McLeod gauge was used to obtain the absolute cross section in H2. The cross sections in NO and O2 could not be obtained by this method, and an approximate correction to direct McLeod-gauge readings was used for these gases. It is believed that the results are as accurate as is possible with the present method. It is difficult to explain the differences found between cross sections measured by various investigators. McLeod-gauge errors appear to account for most of the difference in absolute magnitude.}

In the kinetic analysis, in contrast, different plasma models must be distinguished because the space charge formation depends on the ion velocity distribution at the sheath edge. The differences are significant in particular at low sheath potentials. Explicit formulae are given for the Tonks-Langmuir model and for the charge exchange model. All approximations represent the sheath potential profiles with surprising accuracy.}

The basic features of the plasma-sheath transition and their relation to the Bohm criterion are discussed and illustrated from a simple cold-ion fluid model. A rigorous kinetic analysis of the vicinity of the sheath edge allows one to generalize Bohm's criterion accounting not only for arbitrary ion and electron distributions, but also for general boundary conditions at the wall. It is shown that the generalized sheath condition is (apart from special exceptions) marginally fulfilled and related to a sheath edge field singularity. Due to this singularity, smooth matching of the presheath and sheath solutions requires an additional transition layer. Previous investigations concerning particular problems of the plasma-sheath transition are reviewed in the light of the general relations.},

The atomic scattering is governed by the Moli\'ere potential. Impact-parameter-dependent inelastic losses are included using Firsov's theory. Thermal vibrations of the target atoms and crystal surfaces may be included. Permanent displacement of lattice atoms may be based on either an energy-threshold criterion or a Frenkel-pair-separation criterion. An extensive series of calculations has been made for cascades in the simple metals Cu, Fe, and Au, to test the effects on the results of many of the model parameters. When a displacement-threshold energy is used, the number of Frenkel pairs is found to be a linear function of that part of the primary recoil energy which remains as the kinetic energy of atoms. This result is independent of target temperature, of the presence or absence of inelastic energy losses, and of various details of the model. In contrast, when a separation criterion is used, the number of defects increases less rapidly than linearly. This effect is caused by increased recombination in the highly disturbed tracks of the energetic recoils. Agreement between theoretical and experimental estimates of the radiation damage produced by neutron irradiation of Cu is substantially improved in the latter model.}

To optimize these applications and possibly improve them, one has to understand plasma\textendash surface interaction. This study will emphasize the energy flux as a key parameter in plasma\textendash surface interaction. The technique of passive thermal probes (PTPs) as a suitable diagnostic to measure the energy flux is described and discussed. With such probes, the heating and cooling of a ``substrate dummy'' with a well-defined surface is measured. From the obtained temperature as a function of time, the integral energy flux can be deduced. This integral energy flux consists of various contributions, e.g., chemical contributions such as recombination or oxidation and kinetic energy of plasma species such as impinging ions, electrons, and neutrals. Beginning with a historical overview, this work aims to present the technique of the PTP in its entirety. This includes an explanation of the design along with different calibration and evaluation methods. Exemplary experimental results will be provided to emphasize its versatility and significance as diagnostic for modern atmospheric pressure plasma research.},

  abstract = {The amount of current carried by an electric discharge in its early stages of growth is strongly dependent on its geometrical shape. Discharges with a large number of branches, each funnelling current to a common stem, tend to carry more current than those with fewer branches. The fractal character of typical discharges was simulated using stochastic models based on solutions of the Laplace equation. Extension of these models requires the use of electron distribution functions to describe the behavior of electrons in the undisturbed medium ahead of the discharge. These electrons, interacting with the electric field, determine the propagation of branches in the discharge and the way in which further branching occurs. The first phase in the extension of the referenced models , the calculation of simple electron distribution functions in an air/electric field medium, is discussed. Two techniques are investigated: (1) the solution of the Boltzmann equation in homogeneous, steady state environments, and (2) the use of Monte Carlo simulations. Distribution functions calculated from both techniques are illustrated. Advantages and disadvantages of each technique are discussed.},

Since dust charge is a function of a number of plasma parameters, and the dust charge adjusts itself to changes in plasma conditions instantaneously, dust particles may be used as an ideal diagnostic tool. A major advantage of such a diagnostic approach is its simplicity as the only measurement of a position of a dust particle or its motion after a perturbation is necessary. This technique only requires access to a discharge chamber, dust particles, a laser to illuminate them and a camera to capture the motion of the dust. The dependences of the sheath profiles on the discharge pressure and power have been determined. The radial potential profiles in a cylindrically-symmetrical capacitively-coupled rf discharge and in an IEC plasma were obtained. The direction of the ion flux in the radial IEC discharge was found.}

The neutral-beam source consists of an inductively coupled plasma(ICP)source and parallel top and bottom carbon plates. The bottom carbon plate has numerous apertures for extracting neutral beams from the plasma. When a direct current (dc) bias is applied to the top and bottom plates, the generated positive or negative ions are accelerated toward the bottom plate. Most of them are then efficiently converted into neutral atoms, either by neutralization in charge-transfer collisions with gas molecules during ion transport and with the aperture sidewalls in the bottom plate, or by recombination with low-energy electrons near the end of the bottom plate. We found that negative ions are more efficiently converted into neutral atoms than positive ions. The neutralization efficiency of negative ions was almost 100\%, and the maximum neutral flux density was equivalent to 4.0 mA/cm2. A neutral beam can thus be efficiently produced from the ICPsource and apertures in our new neutral-beam source.},

  abstract = {A modified strongly implicit procedure for solving the system of algebraic equations that arise in the finite-difference or finite-analytic description of field problems is presented. The method is derived for a nine-point difference scheme and can readily be applied to the more conventional five-point scheme simply through the use of the five-point scheme coefficients. The method is demonstrated by application to several examples and a comparison is made between the performance of the modified procedure and that of the strongly implicit procedure, the alternating direction implicit method, and successive over-relaxation. In all cases examined the modified strongly implicit procedure offers superior results when the number of iterations required for convergence or the computational cost required for convergence is used as the measure of performance. The method is also less sensitive to control volume aspect ratio, relaxation parameters, and mesh subdivision than other available procedures. Savings in computational cost for a converged solution range from a factor of two to a factor of four over the strongly implicit procedure. It is felt that the development of this procedure offers a significant advance in the state of the art of solving the finite-difference equations that are used to describe field problems.}

External forces on the particle are measured by means of the displacement of the probe particle in the trap. Measurements can be performed during plasma operation as well as without plasma. The paper focuses on the optical setup and the verification of the system and its principle. Three examples for the particle behavior in the trapping system are presented: First, we measured the neutral gas damping as a verification of the technique. Second, an experiment without a plasma studies the changing particle charge by UV light radiation, and third, by moving the probe particle in the vertical direction into the sheath or into the plasma bulk, respectively, the acting forces on the probe particle are measured.},

Motivated by recent progress concerning the self-assembly of magnetic structures, the equilibrium orientation of eight interacting dipoles in a cubic cluster is investigated in detail. Instead of discrete equilibria we find a type of ground state consisting of infinitely many orientations. This continuum of energetically degenerate states represents a yet unknown form of magnetic frustration. The corresponding dipole rotations in the flat potential valley of this Goldstone mode enable the construction of frictionless magnetic couplings. Using computer-assisted algebraic geometry methods, we moreover completely enumerate all equilibrium configurations. The seemingly simple cubic system allows for exactly 9536 unstable discrete equilibria falling into 183 distinct energy families.}

Their position depends on the detailed structure of the plasma sheath and on the charge that the particles acquire in the surrounding plasma, that is by the electron and ion currents towards it. Bias switching experiments reveal how the charge and equilibrium position of the microparticle change upon altered sheath conditions. Above a critical bias, the particle is subject to an additional downward acceleration that cannot be explained solely by gravity and ion drag. This acceleration can be attributed to a positive charging of the particle induced by extreme out-of-equilibrium conditions of the plasma sheath in its surroundings: locally the plasma sheath can be completely deprived of electrons by means of the bias. We observe similar particle behaviors also in the afterglow of the discharge for a persisting bias voltage on the electrode: damped oscillation into a new equilibrium or (accelerated) fall according to the bias. The observed particle dynamics in locally tailored plasma sheath environments directly monitors changes in electric field structures and plasma density profiles.}

In this situation ions are expected to be dispersed more than in the case of the normal approach. This may be attributed primarily to the effect of grid wires that are not parallel with the source axis. The dispersion leads to a broadening of the flight-time distribution for ions of a given mass-to-charge ratio and hence it degrades mass resolving power. A novel 20 kV matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI) oa-TOFMS instrument has been used in this study to investigate grid dispersion. The results show that the dispersions that ions experience as they pass through grids/meshes that divide regions of different electric field strength have a significant effect on the resolving power when the majority of the wires are not aligned with the source. Numerical simulations of ion motion point to an advantage in using ideal parallel wire grids with line densities in excess of one hundred lines per centimeter, orientated with the ion source axis. The orientation of parallel wire grids has previously been predicted to significantly affect resolving power in oa-TOF instruments. This article presents the first experimental data to demonstrate the effect. Parallel wire grids of such high line densities are impractical to construct and support so a grid design that approximates parallel wires has been lithographically mastered for electroforming 70\% transmission grids with 120 lines per centimeter in one direction and 12 lines per centimeter at right angles to this direction. A resolution loss of 40\% (from a resolution of m/[Delta]m = 8000 at full width at half maximum) was observed when a three-grid orthogonal accelerator constructed with this material was rotated through 90[degree sign] from the predicted ideal orientation. The observed linewidths were in reasonable agreement with those predicted by ion trajectory calculations.},

Neutral beams are generally produced by electrostatically accelerating ions, which are neutralised before injection into the magnetised plasma. At the particle energy required for the most advanced thermonuclear devices and particularly for ITER, neutralisation of positive ions is very inefficient so that negative ions are used. The present paper is devoted to the description of the phenomena occurring when a high-power multi-ampere negative ion beam travels from the beam source towards the plasma. Simulation of the trajectory of the beam and of its features requires various numerical codes, which must take into account all relevant phenomena. The leitmotiv is represented by the interaction of the beam with the background gas. The main outcome is the partial neutralisation of the beam particles, but ionisation of the background gas also occurs, with several physical and technological consequences. Diagnostic methods capable of investigating the beam properties and of assessing the relevance of the various phenomena will be discussed. Examples will be given regarding the measurements collected in the small flexible NIO1 source and regarding the expected results of the prototype of the neutral beam injectors for ITER.

The row number (n) and column number (m) of the elements in the periodic table are used to fit the ?W? shape. The parabolic model is used to approximate the sputtering yield when E {$<$} Ez. Finally, the sputtering yield and the energy distributions of some common elements are used to verify the calculation method of Ez.

Typical fluid theory of a planar sheath with emitted electrons assumes that the plasma electrons follow the Boltzmann relation and the emitted electrons are emitted with zero energy and predicts a potential drop of 1.03Te/e across the sheath in the floating condition. By considering the modified velocity distribution function caused by plasma electrons lost to the wall and the half-Maxwellian distribution of the emitted electrons, it is shown that ratio of plasma electron temperature to emitted electron temperature significantly affects the sheath potential when the plasma electron temperature is within an order of magnitude of the emitted electron temperature. When the plasma electron temperature equals the emitted electron temperature the emissive sheath potential goes to zero. One dimensional particle-in-cell simulations corroborate the predictions made by this theory. The effects of the addition of a monoenergetic electron beam to the Maxwellian plasma electrons were explored, showing that the emissive sheath potential is close to the beam energy only when the emitted electron flux is less than the beam flux.}

The results are discussed in relation to existing theoretical treatments and experimental data; except at very low bombarding ion energies, the agreement with experiment, is very satisfactory. Integral equations governing atomic collision cascades for polyatomic media are shown to have very simple solutions in case of small relative differences in mass and charge number.

  abstract = {Sputtering of a target by energetic ions or recoil atoms is assumed to result from cascades of atomic collisions. The sputtering yield is calculated under the assumption of random slowing down in an infinite medium. An integrodifferential equation for the yield is developed from the general Boltzmann transport equation. Input quantities are the cross sections for ion-target and target-target collisions, and atomic binding energies. Solutions of the integral equation are given that are asymptotically exact in the limit of high ion energy as compared to atomic binding energies. Two main stages of the collision cascade have to be distinguished: first, the slowing down of the primary ion and all recoiling atoms that have comparable energies \textendash{} these particles determine the spatial extent of the cascade; second, the creation and slowing down of low-energy recoils that constitute the major part of all atoms set in motion. The separation between the two stages is essentially complete in the limit of high ion energy, as far as the calculation of the sputtering yield is concerned. High-energy collisions are characterized by Thomas-Fermi-type cross sections, while a Born-Mayer-type cross section is applied in the low-energy region. Electronic stopping is included when necessary. The separation of the cascade into two distinct stages has the consequence that two characteristic depths are important for the qualitative understanding of the sputtering process. First, the scattering events that eventually lead to sputtering take place within a certain layer near the surface, the thickness of which depends on ion mass and energy and on ion-target geometry. In the elastic collision region, this thickness is a sizable fraction of the ion range. Second, the majority of sputtered particles originate from a very thin surface layer ( 5 A), because small energies dominate. The general sputtering-yield formula is applied to specific situations that are of interest for comparison with experiment. These include backsputtering of thick targets by ion beams at perpendicular and oblique incidence and ion energies above 100 eV, transmission sputtering of thin foils, sputtering by recoil atoms from {$\alpha$}-active atoms distributed homogeneously or inhomogeneously in a thick target, sputtering of fissionable specimens by fission fragments, and sputtering of specimens that are irradiated in the core of a reactor or bombarded with a neutron beam. There is good agreement with experimental results on polycrystalline targets within the estimated accuracy of the data and the input parameters entering the theory. There is no need for adjustable parameters in the usual sense, but specific experimental setups are discussed that allow independent checks or accurate determination of some input quantities.}

It is shown that for certain relations between the sphere sizes and the position of the source very high resolution may be obtained. The general restrictions on the performance of imaging retarding fields are considered and a design procedure based upon empirical knowledge of immersion lenses is given}

Beam properties of both standard electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) emitters and arrays of custom made micro-fabricated emitters have been determined. By varying the geometries of the micro-fabricated emitters two basic modes of thruster operation have been identified a high Isp with lower thrust density and a lower Isp with higher thrust density. The versatility of this system allows for a thruster design that has a thrust range spanning two orders of magnitude from 5 to 500{$\mu$}N with highly competitive power requirements 0.05W/{$\mu$}N. The proposed thruster system is designed to meet the needs of future formation flying missions.}

It was established for the first time that solution conductivity has no appreciable effect on the sensitivity of flow rate to applied voltage in the cone-jet mode of electrospray. However, it appears that even when the hydraulic resistance is taken into account, the sensitivity of flow rate as controlled by the applied voltage is additionally related to the emitter exit geometry. These findings are of particular importance to both spacecraft propulsion and electrospray mass spectrometry technologies and suggest careful emitter geometry design considerations will lead to greater control over electrospray properties.}

Understanding the microphysics of individual grains and their interaction with the surrounding environment is a key to properly model various conditions and interpret existing data. The theory and models of individual dust grains are well developed for environments that vary from dense planetary atmospheres to dusty plasmas to diffuse environments such as interplanetary space. However, experimental investigations of individual dust grains in equilibrium are less common, perhaps due to the difficulty of these experiments. Laboratory measurements of dust grains have primarily measured ensemble properties or transient properties of single grains. A technique developed in the 1950's for ion spectroscopy, generally referred to as a quadrupole trap has recently been employed as an electrodynamic balance to investigate single micron-sized dust grains and for atmospheric aerosol research. A description of the theoretical basis and the experimental setup of the electrodynamic balance being developed in our laboratory are given. This laboratory technique lends itself to many applications that relate to planetary atmospheres, heliospheric environments, pre-stellar and pre-planetary conditions, and industrial settings. We present results from some recent experiments carried out to investigate the equilibrium potential of dust grains exposed to far ultraviolet light or to an electron beam. Some future experiments using an electrodynamic balance to investigate the optical characteristics, and condensation process involving dust grains in various astrophysical environments are discussed.}

Furthermore, the velocity directions in the plume remain relatively unchanged for the cusped and direct magnetic field configuration in both overrun and nonoverrun modes. Previously reported plume narrowing in the overrun mode was confirmed and found to be due to the shift of the acceleration and ionization regions toward the anode. The electric field inferred from the LIF measurements allowed calculation of the electron \$E \textbackslash times B\$ drift. Close to the centerline of the thruster, electrons drift azimuthally with velocity decreasing away from the centerline, thus creating shear. This shear can be a source of plasma instabilities and influence electron transport. Further away from the centerline, electrons drift in the opposite direction with their velocity increasing with increasing radius. In that region, electrons rotate without shear.},

This renders the RF plasma source attractive for any long pulse ({$>$} 10 sec) NBI system and in particular for the ITER NBI system. The latter, however, requires that the RF plasma source is also capable of delivering negative rather than positive hydrogen ions. In the first part of the paper the types, characteristics and operation experience of RF plasma sources for positive ions in operation are described. The second part is devoted to the development for ITER NBI: The basic requirements, physics and technology issues and the present status are discussed.}

  abstract = {Possible global distributions of solar-wind-implanted elements in the lunar regolith are considered. Arguments are given that concentrations of such elements are controlled by the rate of their desorption from the implanted layers on the regolith particles. This is confirmed by a large difference in concentration ratios of solar-wind-implanted elements in the regolith and the solar wind. Desorption rate of the implanted atoms is proportional to \$\textbackslash exp(-U/kT)\$, where k is Boltzmann constant and U is activation energy, so it sharply decreases with decreasing temperature. This favors accumulation of the implanted elements in polar regions of the Moon. The implanted layers on the regolith particles damaged by radiation contain a variety of atomic configurations, hence a wide range of trapping energies (characterized by the activation energy U) should be expected for the implanted atoms. High values of U ({$>$} 1 eV) typical of vacancies and broken chemical bonds account for high (by many orders greater than the equilibrium solubility) concentrations of the implanted gases found in the regolith of the equatorial regions. Lower trapping energies U are not effective at low latitudes, but contribute to long trapping of the implanted gases in polar regions. For hydrogen, whose molecule consists of two atoms, inhibited molecule formation at the surfaces of regolith particles can be an additional mechanism of retention of the implanted atoms. Inhibited degassing overcompensates the lack of solar wind flux at high latitudes. This is consistent with the enrichment of the lunar polar regions in hydrogen observed by Lunar Prospector. A similar global distribution can be expected for the other solar-wind-implanted elements, in particular, for 3He that is a potential thermonuclear fuel. Thus, polar regions may be the most promising sites for extraction of 3He, as well as the other gases.}

A bubble is a plasma volume of typically spherical shape, which is separated from the ambient plasma by a negatively biased grid of high transparency. Ions and electrons from the ambient plasma flow into the bubble volume. In steady state the flow of particles and currents is divergence-free, which is established by the plasma potential inside the bubble. The grid has two sheaths, one facing the ambient plasma, the other the bubble plasma. The inner sheath is observed to become unstable, causing the plasma potential in the bubble to oscillate. The instability arises from an excess of ions and a deficiency of electrons. Its frequency is in the range of the ion plasma frequency but depends on all parameters which influence the charge density in the sheath. When the grid voltage is very negative, electrons cannot enter the outer sheath, and the inner sheath becomes a virtual anode which reflects ions such that the bubble interior is empty. When an electron source is placed into the bubble it can neutralize the ions and the bubble refills. Without plasma sources or sinks the bubble plasma is extremely sensitive to perturbations by probes. Modified current-voltage characteristics of Langmuir and emissive probes are demonstrated. A sequence of papers first describes the basic steady-state properties, then the time evolution of bubbles, the effects of electron sources in bubbles, and the role of the grid and bubble geometry. The physics of plasma bubbles is important to several fields of basic plasma physics such as sheaths, sheath instabilities, diagnostic probes, electrostatic confinement, and current and space charge neutralization of beams.},

The reason for this is that, in his paper, Bohm himself misinterpreted his result by concluding that the sheath edge coincides with the reference point of his plasma-sheath model. As a result, the criterion for the reference point obtained by Bohm to ensure monotonicity of his sheath solution (i.e., the Bohm criterion) was erroneously applied to the sheath edge and was used in literature as a criterion for sheath formation. In this paper, we show that the Bohm criterion when applied to the sheath edge contradicts Bohm's own definition of the sheath and cannot be obtained from Bohm's plasma-sheath model.},

A single dust grain is trapped in an electrodynamic quadrupole and charged positively by a monoenergetic ion beam.

A limitation of the surface potential due to ion field emission was observed for the surface field intensity of 3 \textbackslash times 10\^8 V/m, which is a considerably lower value than expected. The density of the discharging current was as high as \textsuperscript{-5\$} A/m2, and increased exponentially with increasing intensity of the electric field. As there are no data of the ion field emission from insulators, we have used the zinc grains for a comparison. Taking into account the irregular shape of used metallic grains, we conclude that the ion field emission from the glass grains starts at a significantly (two orders of magnitude) lower electric field intensity than that from metals. This may lead to the limitation of the attainable surface potential of small insulator grains. The possible effect of the ion field emission on the charging of dust grains in the interplanetary space is discussed.}

A ray tracing calculation is used to model power deposition in the ECR source region. Plasma radial uniformity improves when the microwaves are allowed to propagate several wavelengths ({$>$} 5) before absorption occurs. An explanation for this improved source uniformity is the fact that whistler waves refract toward regions of lower density which, when combined with ECR absorption at the low-density location, forces the profile toward radial uniformity. This effect explains previous observations of flat density profiles in configurations where the magnetic field at the microwave window is raised well above the resonant field. Etch rate uniformity is found to be closely correlated to the ion current density uniformity across the wafer surface in our system.},

Helium, hydrogen, neon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and argon were investigated on tungsten, platinum-blackened-tungsten, platinum, and aluminum surfaces which were contaminated to an undetermined degree with oxides and adsorbed gases. A thermal beam of gas molecules was directed against the test surface at normal incidence, and momentum transfer measurements were obtained with the surface at various temperatures over the range 25\textdegree{} to 550\textdegree{} C. The experimental results indicate that the efficiency of the momentum transfer process increases with the molecular weight of the test gas and the roughness of the test surface, but is relatively independent of the substrate material under the present conditions. The momentum transfer rates for helium and hydrogen are significantly less than those measured for the heavier gases at the same surface temperature. The accommodation of the test gases to the surface temperature appears to be incomplete except, possibly, for argon and carbon dioxide. The results cannot be explained successfully by means of the classical model which assumes that the re-emitted gas consists of two components, one experiencing specular reflection and the other complete accommodation at the surface. A modified model and a corresponding momentum accommodation coefficient are introduced and employed in the discussion of the experimental data.},

With nitrogen as the process gas and particle grain sizes from 5-25 {$\mu$}m, deposition efficiencies of more than 70\% were achieved. The cold sprayed coatings show negligible porosity and oxygen contents comparable to the initial powder feedstock. Therefore, properties such as the electrical conductivity at room temperature correspond to those of the bulk material.

In planar Poiseuille gas flow in a smooth microchannel, the TMAC were calculated considering both the effects of temperature and gas\textendash wall interaction. In the simulation processes, more gas molecules began to be adsorbed near walls under the condition of stronger gas\textendash wall interaction and lower temperature. The gas adsorption resulted in a longer gas\textendash wall interaction time so that the TMAC increased. While the gas\textendash wall interaction became much stronger, more and more gas molecules were adsorbed to form an explicit layer above the wall. The full coverage of gas molecules on the wall prevented further adsorption; therefore the TMAC did not keep on increasing as the interaction strength continued to increase. Meanwhile, the normal momentum accommodation coefficient (NMAC) was also calculated according to the definition. In the isothermal flow, the average gas momentum normal to the wall was in complete accommodation with the wall, and the NMAC was almost unity in smooth micro channels.},

Although traditional chemical propulsion is still widely employed in space flights, it cannot meet the more challenging requirements for deep space travel due to low specific impulse. Electric propulsion thrusters have already helped humans travel further from Earth and have the potential to be developed for interstellar flights due to their advantages such as high velocity increments, long operational lifetimes, high impulse-to-weight ratios and high impulse-to-power ratios. The electrodynamic thrusters have significant potential for applications in the remote regions of space, and several types of electrodynamic plasma thrusters are currently under investigation.

An outline of the physical characteristics of the experiments that has been carried out, and measurements were done to try to elucidate the important mechanisms at work in the Rotamak, which will help design next-generation thruster capabilities.

It is the purpose of this article to ascertain whether these codes can adequately model the plasma/beam interface and hence successfully predict the extracted current and beam form across a broad range of extraction parameters. We found that SEFI could accurately predict the function of extracted current versus extraction voltage and that PBgun gave accurate simulations when the current or current density could be specified near the meniscus. Also for a thin plasma aperture and a fixed current at the meniscus, PBgun gave roughly 60\% of the functional dependence of the extracted current on the extraction voltage and the other 40\% on variations in the plasma pre-sheath.

The analysis of experimental data shows a complex character of the sputtering which can be explained by a simultaneous appearance of three different processes: collision cascade, thermal spike and thermal evaporation of decomposed target material. The analytical expressions for energy distributions given by the three sputtering mechanisms are in very good agreement with the experimental spectra. Physical parameters of the energy distributions: E//b (surface binding energy), T//s//p (mean temperature of the spike) and T (macroscopic surface temperature) are obtained and their physical meaning is discussed. A comparison between existing sputtering theories and results of the investigations is presented.}

The absorption data were analyzed according to the rate equations for these levels and the excitation rate coefficient per unit length of electron drift and per argon-atom density was obtained for each level as a function of the electric field to gas density ratio E/N. The values for the 1s5 level vary from 2.0\texttimes 10-19 to 2.5\texttimes 10-17 cm2 as E/N increases from 5\texttimes 10-17 to 5\texttimes 10-15 V cm2. In comparison with these values, those for the 1s3 level are about one-fifth, those for the 1s4 level are about the same, and those for the 1s2 level are slightly larger in respective measured E/N ranges. In order to estimate the cascading effects from the higher-lying levels, excitation rate coefficients for the 2p and 3p levels have also been measured from absolute intensities of the line emissions. From a comparison of all the measured values of the excitation rate coefficients with those calculated from the Boltzmann analysis, a recommended set of cross sections for these levels has been deduced.}

For consistency, the ion flux energy distribution function is referred to as the ion energy distribution function (IEDf) even though it more accurately represents the one-dimensional ion velocity distribution function. In the past, these devices have operated at voltages less than 1 kV. Higher operating voltages ({$>$}2 kV) are currently desired. For an RFEA to operate at these voltages, design changes are necessary that impact the energy resolution and cause space charge build-up. To investigate the effect the design changes have for a high voltage RFEA, electromagnetic simulations and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations were used to analyze the electric field between the grids, the potential drop in the grid holes, and space charge build-up between the grids. Non-unique optimized dimensions for the RFEA increased the electric field uniformity. The optimization minimizes the electric field from distorting the IV curve or adversely affecting the energy resolution. It was found that a larger grid gap distance and smaller grid hole diameter decreases the potential drop in the grid holes improving energy resolution. IV curves from the PIC simulation were used to obtain space charge distorted IEDfs. The point at which space charge distorts the IV curve is dependent on the grid gap distance and incoming flux. Space charge build-up was found to only affect low energy ions which manifested by cutting off the low energy portion of the IEDf. To fix space charge distortions, the flux into the probe can be limited or it may be possible to account for the distortion when calculating the IEDf.},

Examination of the field and the neutral gas density distributions along the hollow cathode axis made it clear that the optimum field configuration was such that electrons emitted from the hot cathode surface might easily go out of the cathode cavity through the orifice being guided by the lines of force. Beam extraction from an intensively water-cooled small bucket source with the hollow cathode was carried out and hydrogen ion beams of up to 3 A at 50 keV were successfully obtained for the pulse length of up to 10 s.}

In our flexible approach to this problem we employ the commercial IGUN code to calculate the properties of a single beamlet in dependence on various plasma and grid parameters. Then, superposition of all the beamlets at target position yields the broad-beam profile. The plasma parameters are chosen so as to adjust the calculated ion beam current to the corresponding measuring value. This procedure is applied to the broad-beam ion source ISQ 76 with standard grid system. Calculated and experimentally determined broad-beam profiles show a quite satisfying agreement between each other.}

We find that the electron temperature is weakly dependent on the rf power, and thus the electron density can be controlled using the rf power. The electron temperature and density are also modeled and measured in mixtures of two noble gas species. We find that the electron temperature can be controlled by altering the composition of the noble gas mixture. Thus modulation of noble gas admixture ratios and rf power allows the electron density and temperature to be controlled independently. This independent control is shown to maintained with the addition of up to 20\% partial pressure of oxygen, suggesting binary noble gas admixtures may provide additional control of dissociation kinetics.}

Where there are vacancies in the inner shells the species may be detected by subsequent emission of Auger electrons or x-rays. The review provides a comprehensive catalogue of the available data and attempts to correlate the various observations. Optical emissions from sputtered and recoil particles are strongly influenced by radiationless de-excitation processes and this is incorporated into models that describe both line shape and line intensity. There is, however, no well developed description of how the excited states are formed. Thermal excitation models that describe excitation in terms of a Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium plasma are shown to be poorly founded. Alternative models ascribing excitation to bi-particle collision events have not yet been quantitatively tested. Inner shell excitation certainly appears to be governed by electron promotion events in the transient quasi-molecule formed by a projectile and target atom. We review briefly the possible applications of ion induced optical emission to the analysis of surface composition.}

The absence of an undeflected deposit suggests a negligible number of uncharged beam particles. In contrast, by deflection in a transverse magnetic field B the beam is split into a number of circular spots which are found to lie on a straight line. Their displacements correspond to Au\textsuperscript{m+\$} (charged microparticles). From the intensity of the individual deposits the intensity of the beam components has been estimated. The fairly sharp boundaries of the circular spots indicate that the velocity distribution of each component is relatively narrow.

  abstract = {Using the technique described in part I, the energy spectrum of sputtered atoms has been determined for several gold specimens, both single crystals and polycrystalline aggregates. The 110, 110 and 121 directions of ejection were chosen for the experiments. Bombardment was with either 43 kev A+ ions, 43 kev Xe+ ions or 66 kev Xe+ ions. The energies of the ejected atoms ranged from some \textsuperscript{-2\$} ev up to about \textsuperscript{-2\$}, though there were significant deviations from this, particularly for 100 ejection. A theoretical model is developed in which ejection results principally from the generation of atomic collision cascades by the bombarding ion. The assumptions that energy in the cascades is shared by two-body collisions and that the mean collision free path is independent of energy lead to an \textsuperscript{-2\$} spectrum and this prediction should hold roughly from \$10\$ to \$10\^3\$ ev. It is shown that the consequence of surface binding of atoms, with a binding energy \$E\_b\$, is a refraction of atomic trajectories and a peak in the spectrum near \$E = E\_b\$. This random cascade model is unable to explain all features of the spectra, particularly the sharp peaks that appear when they are plotted as time-of-flight spectra. But a more advanced model, which allows for the generation of focused collision sequences by the cascade, fits the data extremely well. This allows for both types of sequence, assisted and simple, and represents their separate characteristics realistically. Deviations from the predictions of the advanced model are confined to energies below 1 ev, where thermal spikes are thought to contribute, and above 103 ev. where the collision free path is probably enhanced by channelling and the normal decrease in cross section with energy. At room temperature the discrepancy only amounts to about 10\% of the total sputtering yield. The random cascade and focused collision sequences contribute roughly equal amounts. From a comparison of the predicted and observed spectra it can be deduced, firstly, that for simple focused collision sequences travelling along the 110 rows the maximum energy of propagation is \$167 \textbackslash pm 25\$ ev and their maximum range is at least 21 collisions; secondly, that for 110 assisted sequences the energy limit is \$500 \textbackslash pm 100\$ ev and the maximum range is about 23 collisions: thirdly, that the effective binding energy to the gold surface in these experiments varied from 2.5 to 4.1 ev. An interatomic potential for Au is deduced, consistent with the observed 110 focusing energy and the bulk modulus of elasticity. In the Born-Mayer form, \$A \textbackslash exp(-r/b)\$, the constants are \$A = 200 \textbackslash pm 60\$ kev and \$b = 2.88 / (14.3 \textbackslash pm 0.4)\$ \AA, valid from 1.4 to 2.88 \AA.}

Three differences were noted: (1) at low argon pressures a broad zone 1-zone 2 transition zone consisting of densely packed fibrous grains was identified; (2) zone 2 columnar grains tended to be faceted at elevated temperatures, although facets were often replaced by smooth flat surfaces at higher temperatures; (3) zone 3 equiaxed grains were generally not observed at the deposition conditions investigated.

  abstract = {The magnetic plasma confinement in magnetron sputtering sources makes the plasma ionization process very efficient and allows high sputtering rates to be achieved with reduced substrate heating, particularly in the cylindrical-post magnetron geometry where a virtual anode separates the substrates from the plasma. Heating flux measurements at typical substrate locations surrounding cylindrical-post magnetron sputtering sources were made for the argon sputtering of seventeen metals, representing a range of atomic masses, crystallographic structures and sputtering yields. The heating flux data are combined with deposition rate measurements and are reported as energy per coating atom deposited. They are consistently interpreted in terms of four basic heating processes: (1) heat of condensation; (2) sputtered atom kinetic energy; (3) plasma radiation; (4) ion neutralization and reflection at the cathode. Ion reflection becomes increasingly important for the high mass materials. The energy per atom deposited is independent of the deposition rate and the argon pressure and varies from 15 to 25 eV atom-1 for light metals to over 50 eV atom- for heavy metals with moderate sputtering yields. The sputtering efficiency is shown to be a useful concept in accounting for ion reflection. Comparative data are reported for sputtering with nitrogen and oxygen and for cylindrical-hollow magnetron sources. The energy per atom is relatively high in nitrogen and oxygen sputtering because of a high sputtering efficiency and a reduced metal sputtering yield. The closer proximity of the plasma in hollow cathodes introduces a plasma bombardment contribution to the heating flux.}

The wavelength difference is chosen to create a 25 \textmu m long periodic beating interferometric pattern allowing a nanometer precise position measurement but limited to within an ambiguity range of 25 \textmu m . The ambiguity is then eliminated by scanning one of the wavelengths over a small range (3.4 nm). We measured absolute distances in the sub-meter range and this with just few nanometer repeatability.}

A part of this paper is devoted to introducing the Langmuir probe technique, especially with regard to its application under conditions when collisions between the charged and neutral particles in the probe sheath cannot be neglected and when the electron energy distribution function in plasma cannot be approximated by a Maxwellian one. In the experimental part we present Langmuir probe measurement of low-pressure and atmospheric-pressure plasma jet systems that are currently used for experiments with deposition of materials with special properties. Most of the experimental results presented in this paper are original data.

The electronic stopping power is assumed to be due to a momentum transfer during scattering of the target atom's electrons in the screened Coulomb field of the projectile and vice versa. The Coulomb repulsion between the nuclei of colliding particles is shown to decrease greatly the electronic stopping in the limiting case of small, reduced energies, E{$<<$}1. This leads to inelastic energy losses being no longer linearly dependent on the particle velocity, as predicted by the linear-response theory. The latter effect explains the experimentally observed strong dependence of the kinetic electron emission well below the threshold on the energy of ions bombarding a solid surface. At relatively large energies (E{$>$}1) the expression obtained reduces to the result found earlier by Lindhard and Scharff [Phys. Rev. 124, 128 (1961)]. The total energy losses of slow atoms calculated on the basis of the formula derived for the inelastic stopping power and the expression for the elastic energy losses available in the literature are in good agreement with the experimental data.}

Additional "intermediate" conditions follow from the requirement that spatial derivatives of the ion velocities are finite everywhere within the plasma volume. The amount of such independent conditions is sufficient to determine, in an iterative way, also the position in the plasma where they have to be imposed. A numerical approach to find unique regular solutions of fluid motion equations, satisfying the generalized Bohm criterion at the plasma boundary, is elaborated and realized for the case of two ion species.},

However, to-date, there have been no reports on the direct measurement of the localized, transient thermal response of a material surface exposed to a plasma. Here, we use time-resolved optical thermometry in-situ to show that the energy flux from a pulsed plasma serves to both heat and transiently cool the material surface. To identify potential mechanisms for this `plasma cooling,' we employ time-resolved plasma diagnostics to correlate the photon and charged particle flux with the thermal response of the material. The results indicate photon-stimulated desorption of adsorbates from the surface is the most likely mechanism responsible for this plasma cooling.},

The nozzle (hollow athode) fabricated of different kinds of materials and alloys works both as a cathode of the radio frequency (RF) hollow cathode discharge and as a nozzle for plasma jet channel generation as well. The RF hollow cathode discharge is a secondary discharge, which is induced by the primary RF plasma generated in the reactor chamber.

This also allows for the first time non-invasive measurement of spatially resolved ion velocity distributions, absolute values of the ion and electron densities, temperatures, and mean energies as well as the electric field and the plasma potential in the entire plasma. The non-invasive access to the spatially resolved distribution functions of electrons and ions is applied to the problem of the kinetic Bohm criterion. Theoretically a so far missing term in the criterion is derived and shown to be of key importance. With the new term the validity of the kinetic criterion at high collisionality and its agreement with the fluid picture are restored.

The ion kinetics is governed by the ionization of neutrals at electron impacts. The plasma consisting of Boltzmann distributed electrons and singly charged ions is in contact with the absorbing negative wall. The derivations are performed in the frame of the ``asymptotic two-scale'' approximation, when the ionization mean-free path Li is much larger than the electron Debye length \$\textbackslash lambda\_D\$. In the limit \$\textbackslash lambda\_D/L\_i \textbackslash arrow 0\$, the plasma-wall transition (PWT) layer can be split into two sublayers: a quasineutral presheath (PS) (with the scale-length Li) and the Debye sheath (DS) (with the scale ?D). Such a subdivision of the PWT layer allows to investigate these sublayers separately and simplify the analysis of the influence of the ion source thermal motion (this has been neglected in the major part of publications up to now). The uniform description of the PWT layer as a single unit is complicated by the singular presheath and sheath structure and by a coupling with the eigenvalue problem originating from the plasma balance in the bounded system. The issue is clarified both analytically and numerically by construction of a matched asymptotic expressions. The equation and the length-scale governing the transition between neighboring PS and DS sublayers are derived. The eigenvalue problem combining the wall potential, the wall location, and the ionization mean-free path is discussed.}

  abstract = {Qualitative analysis of two new effects related to the influence of a strong magnetic field on the state of complex dusty plasmas is given. First, it is shown that the dust shape asymmetry, together with the presence of plasma charging flux, creates an angular momentum flux on a dust grain causing its rotation. The value of the estimated angular velocity is compared with that already observed. The magnetic moment related to the balance of the angular momenta transfer by plasma flux and the friction on neutrals is estimated. It is estimated that the interactions of these magnetic moments are usually much weaker than the Coulomb interactions. Apart from the magnetic moments induced by plasma flux the dust grain can have an intrinsic magnetic moment. Both of them create an average magnetization in complex plasmas. Second, it is shown that an increase in an external magnetic field first decreases the dust charges (when the electrons in the charging process start to be magnetized) and then, with a further increase of the magnetic field, the dust charges increase (when the ions in the charging process start to be magnetized). Only the limiting cases of strong electron and ion magnetization are discussed.}

  abstract = {It is shown that the angular momentum transfer to spherical dust grain from ion flux in the process of grain charging is not zero if the ion attachment coefficient at the grain surface is inhomogeneous. An exact analytical solution is found for a spherical grain having the ion attachment coefficient in one hemisphere \textbackslash kappa+ different from that in the other hemisphere \textbackslash kappa\_\$ and for the charge being uniformly distributed on the grain sphere. The transfer of the angular momentum occurs in presence of the ion flow determined by the ion drift velocity u. The direction of the angular momentum and the direction of the grain rotation axis is determined by the vector product [u \textbackslash cross n], where n is a unit vector directed from one hemisphere with \textbackslash kappa\_+ to another hemisphere with \textbackslash kappa\_-. The angle \th eta between n and u determines the range of impact parameters and the range of impact angles of ions which reaches either one or the other grain hemisphere. This gives an analytical algebraic equation for the range of angles of the impact parameters of ions in the plane perpendicular to the flow which determines the transfer of the angular momentum. The solution of this equation and integration with respect to the impact parameters is obtained numerically. The angular momentum transfer is proportional to (\textbackslash kappa\_+ - \textbackslash kappa\_-)2u\^2a\^2misin(\th eta)F(\th eta,z), where z=2Zde2/amiu2 is the dust dimensionless charge, a is the dust radius, and mi the ion mass. The function F(\th eta,z) is found numerically and for z=2 is approximately equal to F=1+0.24sin\^8(\th eta). With the decrease of z, the absolute value of F (reached at sin(\th eta)=1) gradually decreases and for z=0.1 it is equal to 0.001. The terms with larger power of sin2(\th eta) are prevailing at smaller values of the dust charges. The solution of the equation for the dust rotation was found by taking into account the angular momentum transfer in charging, the friction in neutral gas, and the dust angular momentum inertia. It is shown that in general, after switching on the ion flow, the dust rotates several times until it is aligned to the ion flow (vectors n a- nd u being antiparallel). The number of rotations depends on the the ratio of the friction force to the angular momentum inertia force. The effect of the grain alignment to the ion flow can be used both for the nonmagnetic and ferromagnetic dust grains. The ferromagnetic dust grains can be used to create magnetic fields by dust in absence of external magnetic fields. Continuous dust rotation can be excited by a modulated ion flow.}

The description is based on the radially inhomogeneous kinetic treatment of electrons, ions and excited atoms in the plasma and includes the self-consistent determination of the radial space-charge field and the axial heating field. The determination of the axial field becomes possible by the additional consideration of the most important plasma-wall interaction processes and a balance of the electron surface density on the dielectric tube wall. The results of the description are compared with those of Langmuir probe measurements which makes conclusions about the properties of the plasma-wall interaction processes possible. It is shown that the wall processes and, hence, the wall properties are of great importance for the establishment of the electric field and the kinetic structure of the plasma components in the column.}

Since the beams can be used to locally alter material at the point where they are incident on a surface, they represent direct nanofabrication tools. The authors will focus here on direct fabrication rather than lithography, which is indirect in that it uses the intermediary of resist. In the case of both ions and electrons, material addition or removal can be achieved using precursor gases. In addition ions can also alter material by sputtering (milling), by damage, or by implantation. Many material removal and deposition processes employing precursor gases have been developed for numerous practical applications, such as mask repair, circuit restructuring and repair, and sample sectioning. The authors will also discuss structures that are made for research purposes or for demonstration of the processing capabilities. In many cases the minimum dimensions at which these processes can be realized are considerably larger than the beam diameters. The atomic level mechanisms responsible for the precursor gas activation have not been studied in detail in many cases. The authors will review the state of the art and level of understanding of direct ion and electron beam fabrication and point out some of the unsolved problems.},

In general, the external circuit equations provide a mixture of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions for the Poisson equation, which is solved each time step for the internal plasma potential. We rewrite the coupling between the plasma and the external circuit parameters as an algebraic or ordinary differential equation for the potential on the boundary. This scheme allows decomposition of the field solve into a Laplace solver with boundary conditions (e.g., applied potentials) and a Poisson solver with zero boundary conditions. We present the details of the external circuit coupling to an explicit electrostatic planar two-dimensional particle-in-cell code called PDP2, and discuss briefly how the coupling can be done in an implicit electrostatic code. The decomposition replaces the iterative coupling with a direct coupling and reduces the amount of computational time spent in the field solver. We use PDP2 to simulate a dually excited capacitively coupled RF discharge and show how such a system can be used as a plasma processing tool with separate control over ion flux and ion bombarding energy.}

A two-dimensional capacitive radio-frequency (rf) discharge is investigated in detail. Simple frequency scaling laws for predicting the behavior of some plasma parameters are derived and then compared with simulation results, finding good agreements. It is found that as the drive frequency increases, the sheath width decreases, and the bulk plasma becomes more uniform, leading to a reduction of the ion angular spread at the target and an improvement of ion dose uniformity at the driven electrode.}

  abstract = {The space charge density in low-pressure discharges results from the generation of charged particles, the momentum transfer from these particles to the neutral gas and the electric field. A simplified model is used to treat this process analytically and numerically across the whole plasma. The effect of the electric field alone can cause the formation of the space charge sheath if the ion drift velocity v\_i to the wall exceeds the modified Bohm velocity v\_C = v\_B \textbackslash times (ni/ne)1/2, where v\_B is the Bohm velocity and ni and ne are the number densities of the ions and the electrons, respectively. However, a domain with v\_i \textbackslash geq v\_C can occur only if the effect of collisions is weak. This domain is very narrow and does not come up to the wall. Limits of the electric field strength determining the sheath formation are given. It is shown that the electric field strength cannot be set equal to zero at v\_i = v\_B or v\_C under collisional conditions. The sheath extends from the region near the wall towards the centre and a result of that is to lower v\_i with respect to v\_B as the collisionality rises. These results are used to take into consideration various sheath criteria. The Bohm criterion takes into account the effect of the electric field only and reveals a well-defined sheath edge at v\_i = v\_B. This criterion remains a useful approximation of the sheath edge in almost collisionless plasmas as well. Under collisional conditions the definition of the sheath edge becomes more difficult and a little arbitrary. This paper takes into account new sheath criteria modified for the case of finite collisionality. The divergence between the densities of the ions and the electrons, the gradients of the space charge density and of the generalized Bohm speed v\_C are studied as functions of v\_i or the distance from the wall. These criteria are compared with the collisionally modified Bohm criteria proposed by Godyak (1982 Phys. Lett. A 89 80), Valentini (1996 Phys. Plasmas 3 1459), Chen (1998 Phys. Plasmas 5 804) and Brinkmann},

In this work, we simulate the ion trajectories through a three-gridded RFEA using the simulation software SIMION. Using idealized test cases, it is shown that at high ion energy (i.e., {$>$}100 eV) the transmission is equal to the optical transmission rather than the product of the individual grid transparencies. Below 20 eV, ion trajectories are strongly influenced by the electric fields in between the grids. In this region, grid alignment and ion focusing effects contribute to fluctuations in transmission with ion energy. Subsequently the model has been used to simulate the transmission and energy resolution of an experimental RFEA probe. Grid misalignments reduce the transmission fluctuations at low energy. The model predicts the minimum energy resolution, which has been confirmed experimentally by irradiating the probe with a beam of ions with a small energy bandwidth.},

A new formula for the low-voltage region, which agrees with experimental data better than the formula of R.G. Lye and A.J. Dekker (1957), is proposed. For the voltage region above 4 Vmax, the Lye and Dekker formula is retained, with a smooth transition centered between 3 and 4 Vmax. The directional effect is modeled by adjusting the values of \textbackslash delta\_max and Vmax before applying either formula, rather than applying either Bruining's or Muller's correction factor afterward. This results in an automatic modeling of the known absence of any appreciable directional effect below about half Vmax. Some experimental verification of the formula used to modify \textbackslash delta\_max is presented}

  abstract = {Sputtering has been studied under well controlled conditions, i.e., low gas pressure (1 micron), defined energy (up to 300 ev) and angle of incidence of the bombarding ions, and high ion-current density (10 ma/cm2), by immersing the target in a low-pressure Hg plasma of high density created in a pool-type vacuum arc. It turned out that threshold energies (minimum ion energy for sputtering to ensue) are considerably lower under oblique than under normal incidence, and the atoms are ejected away from the direction of incidence. Thresholds were measured for twenty-three metals under normal incident Hg-ion bombardment. They follow, without exception a simple law: The product of the momentum transferred at threshold from ion to target surface atom and the sound velocity of the target material is proportional to the heat of sublimation of the target material. The threshold energies to be expected accordingly in the case of rare gas ion bombardment under normal incidence are tabulated. The yield (atoms per ion) vs ion energy was carefully measured for the case of polycrystalline Pt. When metal single crystals were sputtered, it was discovered that atoms are preferentially ejected in the directions of closest packing, that is [110] in fcc, [111] in bcc and diamond lattice. Deposits sputtered from plane low-index surfaces of single crystals therefore form characteristic patterns. Their study reveals more details: At low ion energy, only such atoms are sputtered which have no obstructing neighbors in the way of a close-packed direction. At higher ion energy, additional atoms are set free from positions where neighbor atoms interfere. Such atoms deviate in a characteristic way from the directions of close packing. Most atoms sputtered in close-packed directions which are parallel to the surface are trapped again, causing growth of oriented hillocks. The possibility for crystal growth by sputtering was demonstrated in another experiment. Some characteristic features of the etch effects caused by sputtering are described. The basic process in sputtering at low ion energies is one of momentum transfer. The important parameters with respect to the gas discharge are ion energy, angle of incidence, and atomic weight of ion; on the target side they are the atomic weight, the elastic constants, crystal structure and orientation, the heat of sublimation, dislocations, and surface roughness. Many details need durther clarification, and the studies are being continued.}

The collisions in the presheath are modeled by a relaxation time approximation (namely, Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model, or simply BGK model). To find the variation in electrostatic potential with position, the model and analysis from Emmert et al. (1980), are used. Distribution functions of the ions and electrons in a collisionless presheath and sheath on a wall partially reflecting ions and electrons, therefore, can be exactly obtained. The reflections of the ions and electrons by a wall play important roles in studying heat transfer from a plasma sheath to a workpiece surface, and sputter etching and deposition, ion implantation, and ion scattering spectroscopy. Irrespective of ion and electron reflectivities, velocities of the ions in the presheath and sheath are of highly non-Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. The electrons in the presheath are close to Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, whereas those in the sheath are non-Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Even though the wall partially reflects ions and electrons, the Bohm's criterion is marginally satisfied at the sheath edge. The computed distribution functions for a completely absorbing surface agree with theoretical results provided in the literature. Good comparison of the resulted transport variables with available analytical work is presented in the companion paper.}

The results find that dimensionless transport variables of ions and electrons in the presheath and sheath can be exactly expressed in terms of transcendental functions determined by dimensionless independent parameters of ion and electron reflectivities of the wall, ion-to-electron mass ratio, charge number, and electron-to-ion temperature ratio at the presheath edge.

A heat input equivalent of about 10 eV per electron has been determined for a dc discharge. The results for the total thermal power at the substrate are compared with values published by other groups for similar discharge systems. The contributions of different kinds of particles are discussed. For the dc discharge at a discharge power of 50 W and a pressure of 0.8 Pa, a thermal power of 15.6 mWcm-2 has been found which is mainly produced by particles other than the plasma ions. It can be concluded from the increase of the thermal power with decreasing pressure that bombardment by particles originating from the target is the main source of the substrate heating. In an rf discharge the ion energy is two times and the flux density is nearly three times higher than in a dc discharge. Here the dependence of the thermal power on pressure is only weak and mainly the plasma ions transport the power to the substrate.},

A MFMI with the variable-range provides an efficient and economy way to study the exhaust plume of both electric and chemical thrusters. The flexural pivots, replaceable strain gauge, replaceable target plate, and force arm with the variable length make it possible. The designed MFMI with the non-displacement measurement can reduce the influence of pipelines and test lines, especially the elastic force and friction due to displacement. The designed MFMI system with the range of 0\textendash 100 mN and 0\textendash 15 N was calibrated separately. The target indirect measurement method is a simple and economical option for measuring the thrust of electric thrusters, and is employed to measure the thrust of the LIPS-200 ion thruster using the designed MFMI. Research indicates that the sputtering contributes to the momentum transfer of plasma-surface interactions. In addition, the high-speed charged ions from the thruster will experience a charge-exchange (CEX) collision with the slow neutral background. Therefore, the influence of the sputtering and CEX on target indirect measurement method is derived in detail, and then the measured thrust is corrected. The measured average thrust, which is 40.1 mN, demonstrates that the designed MFMI is effective. The designed MFMI can also be employed as a thrust stand by directly mounting the thrusters on torsional arm, and a maximum of three thrusters can be installed on the MFMI at the same time.},

A laser displacement system, which builds upon techniques used by the materials science community for surface stress measurements, is used to measure with high sensitivity the displacement of a target plate placed in a plasma thruster exhaust. The instrument has been installed inside a vacuum chamber and calibrated via two different methods and is able to measure forces in the range of 0.02\textendash 0.5 mN with a resolution of 15 N. Measurements have been made of the force produced from the cold gas flow and with a discharge ignited using argon propellant. The plasma is generated using a Helicon Double Layer Thruster prototype. The instrument target is placed about 1 mean free path for ion-neutral charge exchange collisions downstream of the thruster exit. At this position, the plasma consists of a low density ion beam 10\% and a much larger downstream component 90\%. The results are in good agreement with those determined from the plasma parameters measured with diagnostic probes. Measurements at various flow rates show that variations in ion beam velocity and plasma density and the resulting momentum flux can be measured with this instrument. The instrument target is a simple, low cost device, and since the laser displacement system used is located outside the vacuum chamber, the measurement technique is free from radio frequency interference and thermal effects. It could be used to measure the thrust in the exhaust of other electric propulsion devices and the momentum flux of ion beams formed by expanding plasmas or fusion experiments.}

Passive probes are based on the principle of recording the temperature course during heating and cooling of the probe for calculating the energy influx. The disadvantages of these probes are that the energy influx has to be interrupted by switching off the energy source or by using suitable apertures and by the necessity of knowing the exact heat capacity of the probe. A continuously operating active probe is, therefore, developed which does not need to be calibrated and which compensates the environmental effects as well as the heat conduction by the probe holder. By means of controlled electrical heating the probe is set to a given working temperature and then the energy supply supporting the fixed operating temperature is measured. The energy influx by the plasma is compensated by decreasing the heating power and is directly displayed in J/cm2s. Some practical measurements are presented. Even, if the probe is designed as double probe the directionality of the energy influx can be determined.},

The ion energy distributions (IEDs) were found to exhibit pronounced features, namely a characteristic series of peaks and double peaks, their position and intensity depending strongly on process parameters such as self-bias voltage and pressure. Those structured IEDs have been observed for a variety of gases including argon, oxygen, hydrogen, and benzene. The IED features are explained by the rf modulation of the sheath potential in combination with the creation of thermal ions by charge-exchange processes in the sheath. A model for the ion transport through collisional rf sheaths is presented which satisfactorily explains the observed IEDs. It will be shown that the observed features are an inherent property of capacitively coupled rf discharges. By analyzing these structures detailed information about the spatial field distribution in the sheath and the transport of ions through rf plasma sheaths is obtained. The time-resolved measurements revealed that the ion current behind the cathode is strongly modulated. This temporal modulation has been described by the same theory confirming the applicability of the present model. Finally the electron current was found to be confined to short periodic pulses of 2\textendash 3 ns width.}

  abstract = {Recent experimental results indicate that existing theories of low-energy nuclear stopping power based upon statistically derived potentials, such as the Thomas-Fermi potential, are in error by over 100\%. This paper shows that these errors can be reduced to less than 10\% by using more realistic interatomic potentials. We have calculated interatomic potentials from first principles in the free-electron approximation for 14 diatomic interactions representing light particles incident on heavy targets (M1 {$<<$} M2), self-irradiation (M1 = M2), and heavy particles on light targets (M1 {$>>$} M2). The potentials were approximated by a Moli\`ere-like form and the parameters tabulated for general covenience. The classical orbit equation was integrated numerically for bare potentials and the scattering cross section, stopping power, range, and straggling calculated. Simple three-parameter expressions for the stopping power are given which are directly integrable to obtain the range. The results are in reasonable agreement with experiment for a representative Kr-C potential and agree within 10\% for an average potential derived from the free-electron calculations.}

The simulations were performed using two recent versions, SRIM-2000 and -2003. Irrespective of the choice of the three input parameters of the code (the surface binding, the bulk binding, and the displacement energy), the sputtering yields at a fixed impact energy were found to exhibit an unusual Z1 dependence, which is strongly at variance with experimental results as well as with the predictions of analytical sputtering theory (Z1 and Z2 are the atomic numbers of projectile and target atoms, respectively). As shown in detail for targets of silicon and substantiated for titanium, the ratios of calculated to experimental or analytical yields are generally (much) too large for Z1/Z2{$<$}0.7, decrease rapidly around Z1/Z2=1, and are too small for Z1/Z2{$>$}2 (high-to-low ratios differing by a factor of 3.4 at 1 keV). Additional calculations of the projectile isotope effect in sputtering suggest that the sputtering-yield artifact of SRIM is buried in an incorrect approximation to projectile-target scattering. The low-energy electronic stopping powers of SRIM-2003 were found to be much too low. Differences between detailed and quick calculation modes were also identified. Additional problems are caused by the assumed nonrandom target-atom spacing. The use of SRIM in its present form for calculating sputtering yields and low-energy ranges cannot be recommended. As a by-product of this study it was found by analysis of published experimental data as well as by simulations that, at energies below about 5?keV, the projected ranges of heavy ions in light element targets such as silicon increase with increasing projectile mass, a previously unknown effect.}

By varying the plasma density, we were able to examine the transition region between the "low frequency limit" for rf bias and the intermediate frequency region where, at fixed bias frequency, the ion energy distribution width varies with the plasma density. We find that the experimental ion energy distributions become narrower as the time for ion transit through the sheath approaches the rf period, but that the ion distributions still have widths which are 90\% of their low frequency limit when the ion transit time is 40\% of the rf period. Space-charge-induced beam broadening inside our analyzers appears to significantly affect our measurements of ion angular distributions, especially at low ion energies.}

The data were obtained using a pulsed Nd-Yag pumped tunable dye laser. Determination of the o-perpendicular (velocity component of the sputtered atom perpendicular to the target surface) velocity distribution was accomplished by scanning the wavelength of the exciting laser (the laser beam was normal to the target surface) through the Doppler shifted absorption frequencies of the sputtered U atoms. In order to interpret the observed velocity distributions it was found that one has to pay careful attention to tEe details of the laser induced fluorescence process itself and to the geometry of the optical system used to excite and detect the fluorescent emission. It was determined in the present work that it is essential to know the transition rates associated with the atomic levels involved in the fluorescent excitation and emission process, the laser intensity and bandwidth, the spatial dimensions of the ion beam on the target, and the fluorescent excitation and emission regions as defined by the exciting laser beam and the light collection optics. Neglect of these parameters could lead one to conclude erroneously that sputtered atoms with "negative" velocities are moving back towards the target surface. It is shown that by taking account of power broadening of the atomic lineshape function, which depends upon the exciting laser intensity, one obtains velocity distribulins in excellent ageement with the number density analog of the Sigmund-Thompson model for a linear collision cascade flux density velocity distribution: n(u) do : [u2 /(o 2 + vg)n+ l ]dv, n(v) is the number density velocity distribution, u b is a velocity which corresponds to the assumed planar surface binding energy of the target; and n is a parameter, generally 1 {$<$} n {$<$} 2. The present results indicate that n = 1.85 -+ 0.15 with u b = 2.09 X 105 cm/s (which corresponds to the sublimation energy of solid uranium, E b = 5.4 eV). These parameters were found to be independent of the incident ion (Kr {$\div$} or At*) and of the incident ion energy over the range 1-3 keV.},

In comparison with the transfer matrix method (TMM) the ANC method requires no tedious matrix multiplication so that some computer time may be saved. The ANC method is also better than the pure analytical (closed form) method, since, instead of a few special cases, a uniform beam carrying any number of point masses of various magnitudes or distributions along the beam length can be easily solved. Besides, by using the ANC method, there is no difficulty in taking more modes in the mode superposition equation and hence more higher mode natural frequencies of better accuracy may be obtained.}

When the activity is very low because the total cross section of the comet against the Sun is small, the solar wind has access to the surface of the comet and causes ion-induced sputtering of surface material, which we wish to observe. Methods. We used the Double Focussing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS) of the ROSINA experiment on ESA's Rosetta mission to search for mass spectrometric evidence of sputtered refractory species. In high-resolution mode, DFMS can separate some of the mass peaks of refractory elements from the many volatile species present in the coma. Results. At present, the locations of solar wind surface access are in the southern hemisphere of the comet (the local winter). Of particular interest is sputtering of dust grains on the surface. We observe global averages over the winter hemisphere of the refractory elements Na, K, Si, and Ca, presumably sputtered from grains residing on the surface. Compared to carbonaceous chondrites, the comet has the same Na abundance, is depleted in Ca, and has an excess of K. In addition, for Si the signal strength is strong enough to compile a coarse compositional map of the southern hemisphere. Most, perhaps all, of the observed variation can be explained by the solar wind being affected by the atmosphere of the comet.},

However, due to the nature and the environment of these spraying processes, the feedstock powder structure and properties suffer from decomposition, which subsequently degrade the performance of the coatings produced. The cold gas dynamic spraying process appears to be a promising alternative technique to preserve the properties of the feedstock powder during the coating preparation. Although the latter technique can minimize or eliminate the degradation of the sprayed material, the deposition of cermet using this technique is a difficult task. In this study, two types of cermet powders, the nanocrystalline (WC\textendash 15Co) and the conventional (WC\textendash 10Co4Cr) powders were deposited using the cold gas dynamic spraying and the pulsed gas dynamic spraying processes. The feedstock powders and coatings microstructures were investigated by OM, SEM and XRD, as well as their hardness. The results revealed the possibility of depositing cermet coatings onto aluminum substrates using both processes without any degradation of the carbide phase of the feedstock powder. The cold gas dynamic spraying process experienced difficulty in depositing and building up dense coatings without major defects. The pulsed gas dynamic process produced thick cermet (conventional and nanocrystalline) coatings with low porosity as long as the feedstock powder was preheated above 573 K.}

Reasonable agreement is found between our force measurements and theoretical predictions, corresponding to the regime of moderate ion-dust particle coupling.}

  abstract = {Ion and electron momentum fluxes transport to a biased workpiece surface in contact with a plasma are systematically and kinetically investigated in this study. Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), semiconductor technology, plasma etching, spray deposition, sputtering, cutting and surface treatment, etc. are strongly affected by momentum transfer from the plasma to workpiece. In this work, the plasma is composed of a collisionless presheath and sheath on an electrically negative biased surface that partially reflects or secondly emits ions and electrons. The presheath is an ionization region that continuously produces ions to maintain ion loss to the workpiece, while the sheath is a space-charge region that accelerates ions and retards electrons to the negative biased surface. The predicted total momentum flux at the wall including that of the ions and electrons as a function of negative electrically biased voltage is found to agree well with experimental data. The effects of the sheath and plasma parameters such as net current density, ion and electron reflectivities of the wall, ion-to-electron mass ratio, charge number, electron-to-ion source temperature ratio at the presheath edge, on the total momentum flux, ion and electron momentum fluxes, and their components through the sheath to the surface are obtained.}

Geometric analyses show that the stability of corner contour evolution, which is determined by the ion incident angle only, has a significant effect on the erosion rate of exit edge and the contour evolution of channel wall corner while the initial right-angle of channel wall corner cannot be kept intact under non-uniform ion bombardment.

These findings contradict the potential hump model but are in agreement with a gasdynamic model that describes ion acceleration as driven by pressure gradients and electron-ion friction. The differences between elements can be explained by the element-specific power density of the cathode spot plasma which in turn determines the temperature, average charge state, and ion velocity of the expanding vacuum arc plasma.}

The volume fraction of porosity decreased with a decrease in the distance between the nozzle and the substrate.

Their precise structural and compositional characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the WC and Cr3C2 layers were amorphous, while the TiC layer had a polycrystalline structure. The ion sputtering rates of all three carbides, amorphous carbon and polycrystalline Cr, Ti and W layers were determined by means of Auger electron spectroscopy depth profiling as a function of the angle of incidence of two symmetrically inclined 1 keV Ar+ ion beams in the range between 22\textdegree{} and 82\textdegree. The sputtering rates were calculated from the known thicknesses of the layers and the sputtering times necessary to remove the individual layers. It was found that the sputtering rates of carbides, C-graphite and metals were strongly angle dependent. For the carbides in the range between 36\textdegree{} and 62\textdegree{} the highest ion sputtering rate was found for Cr3C2 and the lowest for TiC, while the values of the sputtering rates for WC were intermediate. The normalized sputtering yields calculated from the experimentally obtained data for all three carbides followed the trend of theoretical results obtained by calculation of the transport of ions in solids by the SRIM code. The sputtering yields are also presented in terms of atoms/ion. Our experimental data for two ion incidence angles of 22\textdegree{} and 49\textdegree{} and reported values of other authors for C-graphite and metals are mainly inside the estimated error of about {$\pm$}20\%. The influence of the ion-induced surface topography on the measured sputtering yields was estimated from the atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements at the intermediate points of the corresponding layers on the crater walls formed during depth profiling.}

Using the same source housing and grid system, we performed our experiments powering the source with a hot filament or an ECR excitation, respectively. In the ion energy distribution we detect various peak structures reflecting the potential profile across the ion source as well as different charge exchange and dissociation processes occurring in the beam. The position of these peaks on the energy scale allows conclusions to be formed about the original charge state of the ion, when produced by charge exchange, or on the original molecule, when produced by dissociation. The most important contribution to the ion beam is caused by process gas ions with important impurities from source materials appearing with reactive process gases. Using electronegative gases, a large amount of negative ions generated in the beam is observed. The performance of both excitation types due to the beam parameters is very similar. A comparable power supplied to the source plasma delivers similar beam currents and profiles. The resulting beam current is determined by the density and the potential structure in the source plasma. The axial potential gradient in the plasma, and with it the resulting beam current, is strongly affected by the total voltage applied between the grids and can be derived from the shape of the main peak in the ion energy distribution. The detected radial beam profile is determined simultaneously by the ion optical parameters of the grid system and the space charge potential in the beam. For a fixed grid geometry the shape of the plasma sheath at the screen grid is an important factor controlling the source performance. The shape of the plasma sheath is simultaneously controlled by the voltage difference between the grids and the Debye length. Changes in the shape can be derived from the ion energy distribution with the experimental results being in good agreement with numerical beam simulations. The only important difference between both excitation types is that using the Kaufman type excitation the potential of the source plasma is exactly fixed by the beam potential, whereas with the ECR source it deviates by several tens of volts depending on microwave power and process gas.}

The ratio between mean ion energy and mean sheath thickness reflects the effect of collisions on the ion energy distributions and enables estimates of sheath thickness and bulk plasma parameters to be made which are compared with values obtained by Langmuir probemeasurements. We are able to demonstrate that changes in sheath potential also affect, via secondary electrons, the ionization regime in the discharge and this can be utilized to control the species composition in the discharge.}

In some regards, this article is also an attempted synthesis of the differing views of these thrusters found in literature, as well as in our own work. In a closed drift thruster, the electric field that accelerates the ions is established by an electron current that passes through and is impeded by a magnetic field. The precessing electrons in this magnetic field follow a closed drift path giving this thruster its name. Closed drift thrusters are divided into magnetic layer and anode layer types, based both on the geometrical and material differences in the discharge channels of the two types, and on the different physical processes that take place within the discharge plasma. Considered as a whole, the publications on closed drift thrusters constitute an impressive body of information that, for the most part, was generated in Russia independently of US research on electric thrusters.}

The main feature of the novel approach is a considerable reduction in the control parameters and a consequent gain in computational speed. Each spiral is built by using a predefined pattern for thrust direction and switching structure. The pattern is then optimised to minimise propellant consumption and transfer time. The variation of the orbital elements due to the thrust is computed analytically from a first-order solution of the perturbed Keplerian motion. The proposed approach allows for a realistic estimation of \$\textbackslash Delta V\$ and time of flight required to transfer a spacecraft between two arbitrary orbits. Eccentricity and plane changes are both accounted for. The novel approach is applied here to the design of missions for the removal of space debris by means of an Ion Beam Shepherd Spacecraft. In particular, two slightly different variants of the proposed low-thrust control model are used for the different phases of the mission. Thanks to their low computational cost they can be included in a multiobjective optimisation problem in which the sequence and timing of the removal of five pieces of debris are optimised to minimise propellant consumption and mission duration.},
