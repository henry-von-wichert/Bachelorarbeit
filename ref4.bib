  abstract = {Photoemission experiments with UV radiation have been performed to investigate the microphysics and charge characteristics of individual isolated dust grains of various compositions and sizes by using the electrodynamic balance facility at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. Dust particles of 2\textendash 10 \textmu m diameter are levitated in a vacuum chamber at pressures {$\sim$}10-5 torr and exposed to a collimated beam of UV radiation in the 120\textendash 200 nm spectral range from a deuterium lamp source with a MgF2 window. A monochromator is used to select the UV wavelength with a spectral resolution of 8 nm. The electrodynamic facility permits measurements of the charge and diameters of particles of known composition, and monitoring of photoemission rates with the incident UV radiation. Experiments have been conducted on test particles of silica and polystyrene to determine the photoelectric yields and surface equilibrium potentials when exposed to UV radiation. A brief description of an experimental procedure for photoemission studies is given and some preliminary laboratory measurements of the photoelectric yields of individual dust particles are presented.},

It is found that the RF fluctuations of the plasma potential are weak. The plasma potential resembles the one of a DC hollow cathode discharge, the RF hollow electrode acts as a cathode due to the self-bias, and a high voltage sheath forms in its inner cylinder.},

Here, the role of reactive gas admixtures on the nanoparticle deposition rates is investigated for the case of reactive direct current magnetron sputtering of Ti in a gas aggregation chamber. The results show that, at low working gas (argon) pressures, stable cluster deposition at high rates can only be achieved for admixtures with a very narrow oxygen flow range. At higher pressures, stable deposition can be observed only after an intermediate maximum rate has been crossed or a stable deposition rate is not reached at all. For the different sputtering conditions, the partial pressure of oxygen was monitored with a mass spectrometer. The results are explained in terms of the competing roles of oxygen in cluster nucleation as well as in target poisoning. The cluster size distributions for different conditions were characterized by scanning electron microscopy.}

It was observed that the deposition rate (DR) of nanoparticles shows a peak followed by a broad tail, even for constant operation conditions. As a key finding of the present investigation, we show that nanoparticle deposition can be stabilized at nonzero DR for the pulsed power regime. Monitoring the oxygen concentration by mass spectrometry provides insight into nanoparticle generation in different processes. Characterization of the nanoparticle film morphology based on transmission electron microscopy reveals a very narrow size distribution. Furthermore, the oxygen admixture has a significant influence on the size distribution and also on the mean size of the formed nanoparticles. In situ analysis of the chemical composition of the deposited films directly after preparation by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows a major contribution by sub-oxide titanium compounds to nanoparticle production.}

Furthermore, the critical role of oxygen (as a reactive admixture gas) in launching and controlling of the NP synthesis process is studied in detail. Employing an RF hollow electrode discharge for processing of silver NPs leads to charging of most of the NPs, and surprisingly, we found that at high RF plasma powers the contribution of charged NPs in the primary NP beam vanished in the treated beam deposition.}

The specific energy that can be deposited into a plasma beam is orders of magnitude larger than the specific chemical energy of known fuels. Plasma thrusters constitute a vast family of devices ranging from already commercial thrusters to incipient laboratory prototypes. Figures of merit in plasma propulsion are discussed. Plasma processes and conditions differ widely from one thruster to another, with the pre-eminence of magnetized, weakly collisional plasmas. Energy is imparted to the plasma via either energetic electron injection, biased electrodes or electromagnetic irradiation. Plasma acceleration can be electrothermal, electrostatic or electromagnetic. Plasma-wall interaction affects energy deposition and erosion of thruster elements, and thus is central for thruster efficiency and lifetime. Magnetic confinement and magnetic nozzles are present in several devices. Oscillations and turbulent transport are intrinsic to the performances of some thrusters. Several thrusters are selected in order to discuss these relevant plasma phenomena.}

We applied this method to measure the force of Ar ions impinging on the substrate during sputter deposition of a-Si:H thin films. The influence of deposition parameters, such as the r.f. power and gas pressure, is emphasized. Increases in the r.f. power and gas pressure are shown to enhance the strik0ng strength of the ions, and thus to promote densification of the film network. This is consistent with the microstructural characterization of films grown under comparable conditions of Ar ion force.}

The model is a good one if the Debye distance is small compared with the relevant scale length. As there is much current interest in radio-frequency (RF) discharges, the question arises as to whether the criterion remains valid in the presence of RF fields. The question has been studied recently by Riemann, following earlier work by Allen who compared the plasma boundary to a sonic surface. Riemann considered a wider range of frequencies and obtained a dispersion relation that was a quartic equation. The present paper examines the complex roots of this equation, using a method developed by Briggs. The results substantiate Riemann's statement that the Bohm criterion is still valid in the presence of RF fields.},

The well-known Bohm criterion for sheath formation, published in 1949, is shown to be closely related to the earlier work of Tonks and Langmuir. The much-used version of the Bohm criterion with the equality sign is obtained by employing the two-scale theory of the plasma and sheath, for the case where \$\textbackslash lambda\_D / L\$ -{$>$} 0. A generalized Bohm criterion is obtained by introducing the ion velocity distribution; the resulting expression can be understood by considering the propagation of ion-acoustic waves.

  abstract = {The transition from dot to ripple formation during erosion sputtering was studied as a function of the angle of incidence of the bombarding ions. For GaSb as target material we found that dot structures are obtained for angles smaller than 10\textdegree{} with respect to the surface normal. We also observed an influence of impurities on the pattern formation. Small amounts of impurities serve as nucleation centers for the formation of differently shaped nanostructures. In addition, larger fragments of GaSb on the surface influence the pattern formation qualitatively; the fragment is sputtered and the sputtered material redeposited in the vicinity assists the generation of ordered dot structures. With the use of low-energy electron diffraction, we looked at the crystallographic surface properties of the dots. Dots produced with a small fluence (3x10\^17?cm-2) could be recrystallized by moderate annealing. Higher fluences, however, cause an irreversible amorphization.}

  abstract = {A transformation of the ion momentum equation simplifies a mathematical description of the transition layer between a quasi-neutral plasma and a collisionless sheath and clearly reveals the physics involved. Balance of forces acting on the ion fluid is delicate in the vicinity of the sonic point and weak effects come into play. For this reason, the passage of the ion fluid through the sonic point, which occurs in the transition layer, is governed not only by inertia and electrostatic force but also by space charge and ion-atom collisions and/or ionization. Occurrence of different scenarios of asymptotic matching in the plasma-sheath transition is analyzed by means of simple mathematical examples, asymptotic estimates, and numerical calculations. In the case of a collisionless sheath, the ion speed distribution plotted on the logarithmic scale reveals a plateau in the intermediate region between the sheath and the presheath. The value corresponding to this plateau has the meaning of speed with which ions leave the presheath and enter the sheath; the Bohm speed. The plateau is pronounced reasonably well provided that the ratio of the Debye length to the ion mean free path is of the order of \textsuperscript{-3\$} or smaller. There is no such plateau if the sheath is collisional and hence no sense in talking of a speed with which ions enter the sheath.},

At one extreme case, films are deposited with ions in the energy range 20\textendash 50 eV, and at the other extreme, ions can be implanted with high energy (100 keV or more) without film deposition. Novel features of the technique include the use of improved macroparticle filters; the implementation of several plasma sources for multi-element surface modification; tuning of ion energy during implantation and deposition to tailor the substrate-film intermixed layer and structure of the growing film; simultaneous pulsing of the plasma potential (positive) and substrate bias (negative) with a modified Marx generator; and the use of high ion charge states.}

The {$\gamma$}E for W is lower than the Cu cathode under identical operating conditions. The results show possible dependence of {$\gamma$}E on the Fermi energy of the cathode material since it influences the probability of electron to be emitted by the incident ion. In addition to this, we found, significant contribution of cathode directed species other than ion to {$\gamma$}E. Further, the effect of pressure on {$\gamma$}E for the N2 discharge has been investigated in the pressure range of 0.5 mbar to 2.0 mbar and its value increases from 0.38 to 0.47 with pressure for the SS304 cathode. The knowledge of {$\gamma$}E successfully explains the governing processes in abnormal glow discharge plasma that cannot be explained by the value of the ion induced secondary electron emission coefficient {$\gamma$}i.

This electrodeless ion source has been rebuilt incorporating several improvements and has been experimentally tested with different discharge diffusion lengths. The improvements include removing the rare earth magnets from the inside of the microwave cavity and embedding them in the cavity walls. The placement and strength of the magnets allows electron cyclotron resonant surfaces ( 875 G) to lie entirely within the discharge zone.

This paper reviews the substantial progress made in the design and application of ECR plasma technology in recent years. Five representative ECR reactor/source designs from large-area 450-cm2 discharges to compact plasma sources inserted into molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) machines are described in detail. The performance of these ECR devices is evaluated by computing performance figures of merit from the available experimental data. These calculations are then compared with the behavior as predicted from a global model of the discharge. This comparison suggests that global plasma models can be employed as an approximate method for ECR reactor design. More extensive diagnostics and numerical models that investigate the spatial variation of ion density and ion energy distributions are also presented. Several illustrative ECR plasma-processing applications are discussed. These include submicron etching of silicon, etching of III-V and II-VI electronic and photonic devices, and the epitaxial growth of GaN. The variety and the sophistication of these applications demonstrate that low-pressure high-density ECR plasma processing technology has evolved into a very useful, versatile group of plasma-processing machines},

The energy of the excited atoms was obtained by deconvoluting the photon intensity vs distance from the surface curves via a formalism recently developed. The observed excited atoms kinetic energy-beam energy dependence supports, together with other work, a new model which suggests that the excited atoms originate from direct (this for oblique angle of incidence of the ion beam only) or near direct recoils produced in incident ion-atom and atom-atom binary collisions at or very near the surface.}

For certain target species this can lead to a novel form of ion-induced sputtering, which, in analogy to the usual kinetic sputtering, has been termed 'potential sputtering'. This sputtering process is characterized by a strong dependence of the observed sputtering yields on the charge state of the impinging ion and can take place at ion-impact energies well below the kinetic sputtering threshold. We summarize a series of recent careful experiments in which potential sputtering has been investigated for hyperthermal highly charged ion's impact on various surfaces (e.g. Au, LiF, NaCl, SiO2, Al2O3 and MgO), present the different models proposed to explain the potential sputtering phenomenon and also discuss possible applications of potential sputtering for nanostructure fabrication.},

  abstract = {In situ characterization of cosmic dust grains typically involves impactionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Considering the performance and limitations of previous instruments, I designed and tested a novel, compact time-offlight mass spectrometer for cosmic dust analysis. The instrument, Dustbuster, incorporates a large target area with a reflectron, simultaneously optimizing mass resolution, particle detection, and ion collection. Dust particles hit the 65-cm2 target plate and are partially ionized by the impact. The resulting ions, with broad energy and angular distributions, are accelerated through the modified reflectron, focusing ions spatially and temporally to produce high-resolution spectra. Initial performance tests of the Dustbuster used laser desorption ionization of embedded metal and mineral samples to simulate particle impacts. Mass resolution (mass/peakwidth) in these experiments ranged from 60 to 180, permitting resolution of isotopes. Subsequent experiments included hypervelocity microparticle impacts. Charged iron and copper microparticles, accelerated to 2-20 km/s in a 2 MV van de Graaff accelerator, impacted the Dustbuster. Mass resolution in these experiments ranged from 150 to 300 for iron and copper. Hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen ions appeared in many spectra. Field-induced emission of electrons immediately before impact is a possible cause of ion formation from species with high ionization potentials. The implications of this ionization effect are discussed in relation to interpretation of mass spectra from other in situ dust analyzers. Another time-of-flight instrument, originally designed as an energy analyzer, shows promise as a high-resolution mass spectrometer for high-flux cosmic dust environments. Ice is an important component of particulates ejected from comets and other icy bodies in the solar system. Due to limited experimental data on ice particle impacts, I built an ice particle source based on a vibrating orifice aerosol generator connected directly to vacuum. Ice particles produced in this manner can be electrostatically accelerated for impact ionization studies. Hypervelocity impact vaporization may have played a key role in the mass extinction that occurred at the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary. In order to study the speciation of gases that may have been produced in such an asteroid impact, I designed a specialized orthogonal extraction mass spectrometer for future laboratory impact experiments.},

The scheme uses plasma thermal energy to charge externally injected sub-micrometer-sized particles and simultaneously create electric fields in the plasma that accelerates them. Particles are subsequently charge stripped and exhausted to produce electrically neutral thrust obviating the need of a charge neutralizer. For reasonable plasma and particle parameters, thrust and specific impulse over a broad range may be produced. The dependence of thrust on particle size, number of injected particles, and plasma temperature density allows for a better thruster precision. The scheme is shown to have modest power requirements. It may be realized in a simple design where there are no high voltage grids or electrodes, charge neutralizer, valves, pressurized gases, etc., and can operate in space or vacuum. A layout for the possible configuration is described.}

This paper reviews the recent research efforts on polymer adhesion with a special focus on adhesion mechanisms.

Recent research on the adhesion mechanisms of mechanical coupling, chemical bonding and thermodynamic adhesion is then discussed. The area of adhesion promoters is reviewed with the focus on plasma and chemical treatments, along with direct methods for adhesion measurement. The topics of polymer blends and reactive polymerization are considered and the interactions with adhesion mechanisms are reported. The concluding section provides recommendations regarding future research on the contentious aspects of currently accepted adhesion mechanisms and on strategies for enhancing polymer adhesion strength.},

  abstract = {The generalized Bohm criterion is revisited in the context of incorporating kinetic effects of the electron and ion distribution functions into the theory. The underlying assumptions and results of two different approaches are compared: the conventional 'kinetic Bohm criterion' and a fluid-moment hierarchy approach. The former is based on the asymptotic limit of an infinitely thin sheath (\textbackslash lambda\_D / l = 0), whereas the latter is based on a perturbative expansion of a sheath that is thin compared to the plasma (\textbackslash lambda\_D / l {$<<$} 1). Here lambda\_D is the Debye length, which characterizes the sheath length scale, and l is a measure of the plasma or presheath length scale. The consequences of these assumptions are discussed in terms of how they restrict the class of distribution functions to which the resulting criteria can be applied. Two examples are considered to provide concrete comparisons between the two approaches. The first is a Tonks\textendash Langmuir model including a warm ion source (Robertson 2009 Phys. Plasmas 16 103503). This highlights a substantial difference between the conventional kinetic theory, which predicts slow ions dominate at the sheath edge, and the fluid moment approach, which predicts slow ions have little influence. The second example considers planar electrostatic probes biased near the plasma potential using model equations and particle-in-cell simulations. This demonstrates a situation where electron kinetic effects alter the Bohm criterion, leading to a subsonic ion flow at the sheath edge.},

In plasmas with two species of positive ions, ion\textendash ion two-stream instabilities can also be excited. The stability phase-space is characterized using the Penrose criterion and approximate linear dispersion relations.

The salient difference between the two results is that low-velocity particles dominate in the conventional theory, but are essentially unimportant in the new theory. It is shown that the derivation of the conventional kinetic Bohm criterion is flawed. Low-velocity particles can cause unphysical divergences in the conventional theory. These divergent contributions are avoided with this new approach. The two theories are compared using example distribution functions from previous presheath models. The importance of ion-ion and electron-electron collisions to determining the particle distribution functions throughout the presheath is also discussed. A kinetic equation that accounts for wave-particle scattering by convective instabilities is used to show that ion-acoustic instabilities in the presheath of low temperature plasmas (where Te{$>>$}Ti) can cause both ions and electrons to obtain Maxwellian distribution functions near the sheath.},

Longitudinal ion velocity distribution functions have been recorded until inside the plasma sheath. The shapes of these distribution functions are in qualitative agreement with the results of a theoretical model and give an experimental justification for the "flux" shape of the ion velocity distribution source function retained in this model. However, to reach this qualitative agreement, it is necessary to adjust the ionic temperature for each distribution function suggesting that, for the authors' weakly ionized plasma, another heating mechanism is missing in this theory.}

  abstract = {The present paper summarizes the main features of the hollow cathode discharges generated by a radio frequency (r.f.) instead of a d.c. field. The pressure of gas inside the hollow cathode is almost independent on the reactor pressure, which allows to generate discharge at high collision frequency and transport it into the low pressure reactor. The discharge forced out from the hollow cathode forms a decaying plasma channel with extraordinary properties. Gas metastables excited inside the cathode can act in selected gas mixtures as a source of additional heat, thereby enhancing thermionic electron emission and ionization of the gas. An arc regime can be started from the glow discharge simply by increasing the r.f. power. Hollow cathode arc in the cathode metal vapor can be sustained even without working gas. Examples of utilization of hollow cathodes in the film deposition and dry etching technology are presented. Small size cylindrical r.f. cathodes allow special applications inside narrow ({$<$}10 mm in diameter) tubes. Linear arc discharge (LAD) produced by r.f. hollow cathode with magnetic focusing promises new applications either with or even instead of magnetrons.},

The utilization of cylindrical RF hollow cathodes in both the plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and the physical vapour deposition (PVD) of films is reviewed. An example of the high rate PECVD of Si-N films is described in more detail. Gas metastables excited inside the cathode can act as a source of additional heat, thereby enhancing the thermionic electron emission and ionization of the gas. Transition from the glow into a hot cathode arc regime is characterized by changes in the plasma parameters and consequently in the growth of films. Examples for PVD of TiN films are shown. Magnetic focusing in the linear arc discharge source leads to the formation of linear hot zones at the outlet of the parallel-plate cathode and enables the hollow cathode discharges to be scaled up for large area applications.},

Practically, this hybrid pulse mode is a combination of the conventional unipolar and bipolar pulsed powering, where the time slices of both pulse modes can be freely adjusted at a time scale smaller than 1 ms, i.e. much shorter than necessary for the deposition of one monolayer. This allows varying the average plasma parameters freely between the typical values of unipolar and bipolar pulse mode. During deposition of piezoelectric AlN, the film stress could be shifted in a wide range by changing the pulse mode ratio. In combination with the other known process parameters, it was possible to shift the film stress between compressive and tensile while maintaining piezoelectric properties. Hence, in addition to classical deposition parameters such as pressure or temperature, this new parameter gives an additional degree of freedom for optimization of film properties independent from sputtering power and deposition rate.},

This technique is based on the observation of line emission from a neutral Li atom beam, which is injected into the plasma and excited by electron collisions. A collisional-radiative model valid for the injected Li atoms is used to predict the emission intensities as function of n e and T\_e for several lines theoretically. In contrast to the electron temperature regime representative for the edge of tokamak discharges (T\_e {$>$} 5 eV), the ECR discharge offers a T\_e range where selected line intensity ratios strongly depend on the electron temperature. Therefore, a comparison of the measured ratios with the calculated ones yields T\_e profiles for the first time. The n\_e measurement is performed as in tokamaks by observing the attenuation of the beam due to ionization in the plasma. We present radial profiles of T\_e and n e for discharges in argon and xenon under different operating conditions. These results are compared with results obtained by Thomson scattering. Our measurements give evidence for a satisfying agreement between the two methods.},

Positive ion spectra reveal the presence of protonated water clusters and H+ : HMDSO and H3O+ : HMDSO ions. These ions are most probably produced by photoionization. This is corroborated by optical emission spectroscopy data obtained in the wavelength range of 50\textendash 300 nm, where helium excimer continuum emission centred around 84 nm has been observed. No ion driven polymerization products of HMDSO have been detected. Measurements of neutral species have allowed the quantification of the HMDSO depletion and absolute densities of trimethylsilanol and pentamethyldisiloxane. Two neutral polymerization products have been observed as well. The results indicate that the Si\textendash O bond of HMDSO is preferentially broken.

  abstract = {Reactive plasmas are highly valued for their ability to produce large amounts of reactive radicals and of energetic ions bombarding surrounding surfaces. The non-equilibrium electron driven plasma chemistry is utilized in many applications such as anisotropic etching or deposition of thin films of high-quality materials with unique properties. However, the non-equilibrium character and the high power densities make plasmas very complex and hard to understand. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a very versatile diagnostic method, which has, therefore, a prominent role in the characterization of reactive plasmas. It can access almost all plasma generated species: stable gas-phase products, reactive radicals, positive and negative ions or even internally excited species such as metastables. It can provide absolute densities of neutral particles or energy distribution functions of energetic ions. In particular, plasmas with a rich chemistry, such as hydrocarbon plasmas, could not be understood without MS. This review focuses on quadrupole MS with an electron impact ionization ion source as the most common MS technique applied in plasma analysis. Necessary information for the understanding of this diagnostic and its application and for the proper design and calibration procedure of an MS diagnostic system for quantitative plasma analysis is provided. Important differences between measurements of neutral particles and energetic ions and between the analysis of low pressure and atmospheric pressure plasmas are described and discussed in detail. Moreover, MS-measured ion energy distribution functions in different discharges are discussed and the ability of MS to analyse these distribution functions with time resolution of several microseconds is presented.},

  abstract = {Mit einem einfachfokussierenden 60\textdegree -Massenspektrometer wurden die Sekund\"arionenspektren und die Energieverteilungen einer Reihe von Sekund\"arionen, die bei der Zerst\"aubung durch Quecksilberionen (200 bis 2000 eV) auftreten, gemessen. Der Ionennachweis erfolgte mit einem offenen Z\"ahlrohr. Es wurden drei verschiedene Aluminiumkathoden und eine Magnesiumkathode untersucht. Die Bestimmung der Energieverteilung erfolgte durch Gegenfeldmessungen bzw. aus der Form der Massenlinien. Das Sekund\"arionenspektrum zeigt neben den Ionen des Targetmetalles auch solche der Verunreinigungen sowohl aus dem Target selbst als auch aus dem Restgas. Bei einer Duraluminiumkathode konnten die Legierungsbestandteile qualitative erfa\ss t werden. Die M\"oglichkeit der Verwendung einer Zerst\"aubungsionenquelle f\"ur massenspektroskopische Analysen wird diskutiert. Die Energieverteilungen der Sekund\"arionen wurden f\"ur Al+-Ionen aus reinem Aluminium bei unterschiedlichen Prim\"arionenenergien zwischen 200 und 2000 eV gemessen. Die neutralen Al-Atome konnten nach einer nachtr\"aglichen Ionisierung durch Elektronensto\ss{} auf ihre Energieverteilung hin untersucht werden. Innerhalb der Fehlergrenze zeigte die Energieverteilung der Al-Atome aus einem Al-Target bei 800 eV Prim\"arionenenergie gleiches Verhalten wie der Al+-Ionen, die bei demselben Zerst\"aubungsvorgang entstanden. Die Energieverteilung der Al+-Ionen, aus einer Aluminiumlegierung (Duraluminium) zeigte bei gleicher Prim\"arionenergie gegen\"uber solchen aus einer reinen Aluminiumkathode eine starke Verschiebung zu kleinen Energien. Die Energieverteilung von Ionen, die von Verunreinigungen im Targetvolumen oder an der Oberfl\"ache stammen, wurde an sieben verschiedenen Ionenarten untersucht. Es zeigte sich, da\ss{} die Energie der Fremdionen immer wesentlich niedriger ist als die der Al+-Ionen avs der gleichen Kathode. F\"ur die Molek\"ulionen AlOH+ und H2O+ wurde ein prinzipiell gleiches Verhalten der Energieverteilung gefunden wie f\"ur die Atomionen Mg+, Na+, K+ and Ni+. Das bedeutet, da\ss{} die H2O+-Ionen aus der Adsorptionsschicht auf dem Target und nicht aus dem Volumen vor dem Target stammten. Gleiche Fremdionen aus unterschiedlichen Kathoden zeigen unterschiedliche Energieverteilungen. Die \"Anderung der Energie erfolgt dabei in demselben Sinne wie f\"ur die aus den entsprechenden Kathoden ausgel\"osten Al+-Ionen: Die Energien sind f\"ur Duraluminium niedriger als f\"ur reines Aluminium. Die beobachteten Unterschiede in den Energieverteilungen lassen sich verstehen, wenn man die Zerst\"aubung als Folge eines Impuls\"ubertragungsvorgangs innerhalb und an der Oberfl\"ache der Kathode betrachtet. Danach erfolgt eine \"Ubernahme des Impulses des einfallenden Ions in einer Reihe von St\"o\ss en durch die Gitteratome. Durch fokussierende St\"o\ss e gelangt ein Teil der Energie wieder an die Oberfl\"ache des Targets. Es wird gezeigt, da\ss{} ein Oberfl\"achenatom nur den Anteil \$E0 \textbackslash cdot F (F \textbackslash leq 1)\$ der Energie E0, die die Sto\ss folge an die Targetoberfl\"ache transportiert, \"ubernehmen kann. Ist das Oberfl\"achenatom ein Atom des Grundmaterials des Targets, dann gilt F = 1, handelt es sich um ein Fremdatom, dann gilt F {$<$} 1. Durch \$F = \textbackslash cos\^2 \textbackslash alpha \textbackslash cdot k\$ wird sowohl die unvollst\"andige Energie\"ubertragung zwischen zwei Atomen unterschiedlicher Masse (k) als auch die nicht dem Aufbau des Gitters entsprechende Lage des Fremdatoms an der Oberfl\"ache des Targets ({$\alpha$}) ber\"ucksichtigt. Eine halb quantitative Erkl\"arung der Unterschiede in den Energieverteilungen der Fremdionen und der Al+-Ionen ist mit Hilfe dieses Energie\"ubertragungsfaktors F m\"oglich. Eine genaue Betrachtung des Abl\"osevorganges erfordert die Ber\"ucksichtigung der Abl\"osungsenergie A, die abh\"angig ist vom Target, von der Art der emittierten Teilchen und davon, ob sie neutral oder ionisiert die Oberfl\"ache verlassen. Die Unterschiede in den Energieverteilungen gleicher Ionen aus verschiedenem Targetmaterial werden auf Unterschiede in der Verteilung der durch St\"o\ss e an die Oberfl\"ache transportierten Energie Ee, f\"ur die verschiedenen Kathoden zuruckgef\"uhrt. Die Tatsache, da\ss{} die Unterschiede in den Energieverteilungen mit Hilfe des Impuls\"ubertragungsmodelles befriedigend erkl\"art werden k\"onnen, stellt einen weiteren starken Beweis f\"ur die Richtigkeit der Impulstheorie dar, die auf Grund der von Wehner durchgef\"uhrten Zerst\"aubungsversuche an Einkristallen aufgestellt worden ist.}

The review is preferentially focused on experimental results and the corresponding experimental methods; theories about sputtering phenomena are used more as guide-lines for discussion and comparison. The four main areas considered are sputtering of (1) metals, (2) alkali halides, (3) frozen gases, and sputtering by (4) MeV ion impact on insulators. Analysis of the experimental data on energy and angular distributions has revealed a large variety of sputtering modes such as elastic and inelastic collisional sputtering, ion-induced thermal evaporation, ejection of excited atoms, sputtering due to exciton decay, formation of clusters or ejection of grains, sputtering by shock waves and formation of craters associated with an explosive gas flow. The comparison of experimental and theoretical data shows that the theory of linear collision cascades is a good basis for an understanding of the elastic sputtering processes. Also, recent computer simulations of sputtering give valuable insight into collisional processes. The situation is more complex when electronic excitation is the driving interaction of the sputtering process. In this case, depending on the type of target material and the energy loss of the primary ions, a large number of theoretical attempts have been made to describe individual phenomena attributed to electronic sputtering.}

  abstract = {We report on relative and absolute intensity calibrations of a modern broadband echelle spectrometer (type ESA 3000\textregistered{} trademark of LLA Instruments GmbH, Berlin) for use in the diagnostics of low-temperature plasma. This type of device measures simultaneously complete emission spectra in the spectral range from 200 to 800 nm with a spectral resolution of several picometres by using more than 90 spectral orders, causing a strongly structured efficiency function. The assumptions and approximations entering the calibration procedure under these conditions are discussed in section 3. For coping with the strongly structured efficiency function a continuum light source is needed, which covers the entire spectral range. Furthermore, the variation of its intensity must be low enough to ensure that neither statistical errors perturb the calibration in regions with low photon flux and/or low efficiency, nor local memory overflow in regions with high photon flux or high efficiency. In our case this requires that during calibration over the whole spectral range of the spectrometer the counts per pixel in one measurement vary at highest by a factor 10 to 12. Usual broadband light sources do not meet this latter requirement. We, therefore, use an uncalibrated `composite' source, an adjustable combination of a standard tungsten strip lamp and a deuterium lamp, and calibrate the spectrometer in a two-step process against the tungsten strip lamp and well-known rovibrational intensity distributions in the emission spectra of NO and N2. We adjust the composite source in a way to produce a perturbation-free first approximation of an (uncalibrated) efficiency function, which is then corrected and thus calibrated by comparison with the (secondary) standards mentioned above. For absolute calibration we use the tungsten strip lamp. The uncertainty attained in this way for the relative calibration depends on the wavelength and varies between 5\% and 10\%. For the absolute calibration we obtained an uncertainty of 12\%. We further discuss problems caused by the non-uniform spectral efficiency and dispersion of the spectrometer, which complicate the calibration procedure.},

It was developed for determining ion range and damage distributions as well as angular and energy distributions of backscattered and transmitted ions. The computer program provides particularly high computer efficiency, while still maintaining a high degree of accuracy. This is achieved mainly by applying a new analytic formula for determining nuclear scattering angles based on the Moli\`ere potential, and by suitably expanding the distance between collisions at high energies. With these improvements it becomes feasible for the first time to assess accurately both low and high energy problems with high precision using a single simulation program.}

The influence of the interatomic potential and the inelastic energy loss model as well as the surface binding energy on the sputtering yield is investigated. Further results are sputtering yields versus incident energy and angle as well as total angular distributions of sputtered particles and energy distributions in specific solid angles for non-normal incidence. The calculated data are compared with experimental results as far as possible. From this comparison it turns out that the TRIM.SP is able to reproduce experimental results even in very special details of angular and energy distributions.}

The ball was either levitated freely between horizontally oriented electrodes or constrained to move horizontally between vertically oriented electrodes to determine the charge carried by the ball. In both cases theory could be reconciled with experiment, but only if space charge, modified electric force due to the geometry of the system, effective density of the ball in the liquid for inertial force calculation and modified viscous drag due to a high Reynolds number of movement were taken into account.

  abstract = {Despite some disagreement in experimental findings, especially regarding the secondary energy spectrum, and the lack of well-tried theoretical methods, moderate progress has been made in the understanding of the ionization process in secondary ion emission. Experimentally, conclusive evidence has been obtained for the existence of at least two excitation mechanisms: a collisional mechanism, which prevails in the production of multicharged ions, and a mechanism originating in the separation of the outgoing particle from its solid environment. The role of foreign atoms (host atoms in alloys, associated species in covalent and ionic compounds, surface contaminants such as oxygen and caesium), although often considerable, is not fully understood owing to the complex influence of the environment, and its description is at present limited mainly to some empirical rules of relative validity. Theoretically, if many approaches have been proposed, few prove to rely on valid physical foundations. Among the latter, an earlier theory which explains the emission of multicharged ions rather well, describes ionization in terms of Auger decay outside the target of collision-induced core hole excitations. In a second kind of approach, probably of more general significance, it is postulated that ionization results from the perturbation of outer atomic electrons during the separation of the outgoing particle from the surface. Its mathematical treatment has been made possible by recent progress in the many-body theory of localized time-dependent perturbations, but much work remains to be done in this direction. A third kind of approach, regarding ionization as induced by diffuse excitation of the surrounding electron gas, remains in the field of conjecture.}

  abstract = {The ion energy is known to have a strong influence on the properties of coatings deposited by physical vapor deposition (PVD). Therefore, the ion energy distribution (IEDF) especially measured at the substrate side is of great interest for understanding the coating growth. In PVD coating processes the ion energy at the substrate can be adjusted by applying a negative voltage (bias) to the substrate table. In the present work, mass integrated measurements of the IEDF were carried out during a high power pulsed magnetron sputtering (HPPMS) (Cr,Al)N process using a Cr target with 20 plugs of Al within an industrial scale PVD coating unit. The HPPMS cathode was operated with different average powers (1 kW, 3 kW and 5 kW) and pulse lengths (ton) of 40 {$\mu$}s, 80 {$\mu$}s and 200 {$\mu$}s at constant frequency of 500 Hz. In a first step, measurements of the IEDF using retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA) were carried out on grounded substrate table and later on using -100 V substrate bias. Additionally, measurements of the IEDF were carried out using mass spectrometer (MS) exemplary to compare with the results from RFEA. By comparing the measured IEDFs some limitations of these two different measurement methods were found. The MS underestimates that the amount of high energetic ions and the RFEA measurement are influenced by the incidence angle of the ions. Besides those limitations the influence of cathode power and HPPMS pulse length on the IEDF was studied. At high peak power density, i. e. short pulse length and high average cathode power, a much greater high energetic fraction in the IEDF between 10 and 50 eV was found in the results of the RFEA compared to MS results presented here. Also the effective mean ion temperature in the high energetic region of the IEDF was found to increase with increasing peak power density. Furthermore, the effective mean ion temperature was not strongly influenced using substrate bias.},

The discharge is in pure argon at pressures in the 100 mtorr range, frequency 13.56 MHz, and rf voltage amplitudes on the order of 100 V. The model is based on solutions of the continuity, momentum (drift-diffusion), and energy equations for the electrons, continuity, and drift-diffusion equation for positive ions, coupled with the Poisson equation. The results of the model are qualitatively and quantitatively in good agreement with the experiments. The model predicts a maximum of plasma density off axis, as in the experiment. The ion current density on the electrode is also nonuniform, and increases radially in the conditions of the experiments. The effects of the rf voltage, pressure, and reactor geometry (electrode dimensions, gap length, guard rings, etc.) on the plasma properties and on the uniformity of the ion current on the powered electrode are also discussed. It is shown that the existence of a maximum of plasma density in the radial direction, in the conditions of the experiment, is due to the small value of the electrode spacing. The results show that the harmonic content of the discharge current is also geometry dependent. The comparisons show that 2D, three-moment fluid models can accurately describe the discharge and the effects of the chamber geometry on the plasma properties for pressure above the limit where collisionless electron heating does not play a significant role.}

  abstract = {The relationship of mind and matter is approached in a new way in this article. This approach is based on the causal interpretation of the quantum theory, in which an electron, for example, is regarded as an inseparable union of a particle and afield. This field has, however, some new properties that can be seen to be the main sources of the differences between the quantum theory and the classical (Newtonian) theory. These new properties suggest that the field may be regarded as containing objective and active information, and that the activity of this information is similar in certain key ways to the activity of information in our ordinary subjective experience. The analogy between mind and matter is thus fairly close. This analogy leads to the proposal of the general outlines of a new theory of mind, matter, and their relationship, in which the basic notion is participation rather than interaction. Although the theory can be developed mathematically in more detail, the main emphasis here is to show qualitatively how it provides a way of thinking that does not divide mind from matter, and thus leads to a more coherent understanding of such questions than is possible in the common dualistic and reductionistic approaches. These ideas may be relevant to connectionist theories and might perhaps suggest new directions for their development.}

  abstract = {A four-grid electrostatic energy analyzer for measurements of the ion velocity distribution and the emission of secondary electrons on the electrodes of low-pressure radio frequency glow-discharge systems has been conceived. Problems arising from poor analyzer design are discussed and the performance of the presented analyzer is shown for measurements of the ion velocity distribution in pure hydrogen, helium, and argon discharges. Moreover, the secondary electron yields on aluminium, stainless steel, copper, and amorphous silicon exposed to radio frequency argon, helium, and hydrogen plasmas are determined in situ, for the first time to our knowledge. In parallel-plate radio frequency dischargessecondary electron emission involves the contributions of ions, fast neutrals, metastables, and photons impinging on the electrode surfaces. Therefore, secondary electron emission must be considered as a global phenomenon. Global secondary electron emission can be up to ten times larger than only ion-induced secondary electron emission. Typically, the global emission coefficient is of the order of 0.1 (secondary electrons per ion) but can exceed 1 when the contribution of metastables is important. This is a noteworthy result since secondary electron emission is often neglected or underestimated in modeling of electrical discharges.},

  abstract = {The physical processes at the interface of a low-temperature plasma and a solid are extremely complex. They involve a huge number of elementary processes in the plasma, in the solid as well as charge, momentum and energy transfer across the interface. In the majority of plasma simulations these surface processes are either neglected or treated via phenomenological parameters such as sticking coefficients, sputter rates or secondary electron emission coefficients. However, those parameters are known only in some cases, so such an approach is very inaccurate and does not have predictive capability. Therefore, improvements are highly needed. In this paper we briefly summarize relevant theoretical methods from solid state and surface physics that are able to contribute to an improved simulation of plasma-surface interaction in the near future. Even though the (quantum-mechanical) equations of motion for the participating charged and neutral particles are known, in principle, full ab initio quantum simulations are feasible only for extremely short times and/or small system sizes. A substantial simplification is achieved when electronic quantum effects are not treated explicitly. Then one arrives at much simpler semi-classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the heavy particles that have become the main workhorse in surface science simulations. Using microscopically (i.e., density functional theory) founded potentials and force fields as an input, these MD simulations approach the quality of ab initio simulations, in many cases. However, despite their simplified nature, these simulations require a time step that is of the order or below one femtosecond making it prohibitive to reach experimentally relevant scales of seconds or minutes and system sizes of micrometers. To bridge this gap in length and time scales without compromising the first principles character and predictive power of the simulations, many physical and computational strategies have been put forward in surface science. This paper presents a brief overview on different methods and their underlying physical ideas, and we compare their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we discuss their potential relevance for future plasma-surface simulations. The first class are 'acceleration' techniques that include metadynamics, hyperdynamics, temperature accelerated dynamics, collective variable driven hyperdynamics and others. Recently we have presented a novel approach: selective process acceleration (Abraham et al 2016 J. Appl. Phys. 119 185301) which we discuss in some more detail. The second promising route to longer accurate simulations is dynamical freeze out of dominant modes which we have introduced recently for the simulation of neutral atom sticking on a metal surface (Filinov et al 2018 Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 27 064003). In this article we give a more general view on this method that allows to accurately combine first principles MD simulations with semi-analytical models and discuss possible applications that are of potential relevance for plasma physics.},

Different aspects connected to the formation of particulates in an argon-silane RF reactor have been studied in this work. The first one concerns the formation of the particulates:their size kinetics and structural characteristics give evidence of a multistep growth process. The second concerns the influence of the presence of particles on plasma parameters and discharge properties: the experimental data are in good agreement with predictions of theoretical models and both reveal the strong influence of the dust on plasma physics and chemistry. The last aspect concerns the specificinterest of dusty plasmas as a source of new basic problems in plasma physics. In our conditions,where high concentrations of particles are easily achieved, it is shown that the cloud of negatively charged dust particles forms a coulombian liquid while the positive ions plav the role of a neutralizing background.},

DBDs are a typical example of nonthermal atmospheric or normal pressure gas discharges. Initially used for the generation of ozone, they have opened up many other fields of application. Therefore DBDs are a relevant tool in current plasma technology as well as an object for fundamental studies. Another motivation for further research is the fact that so-called partial discharges in insulated high voltage systems are special types of DBDs. The breakdown processes, the formation of structures, and the role of surface processes are currently under investigation. This review is intended to give an update to the already existing literature on DBDs considering the research and development within the last two decades. The main principles and different modes of discharge generation are summarized. A collection of known as well as special electrode configurations and reactor designs will be presented. This shall demonstrate the different and broad possibilities, but also the similarities and common aspects of devices for different fields of applications explored within the last years. The main part is devoted to the progress on the investigation of different aspects of breakdown and plasma formation with the focus on single filaments or microdischarges. This includes a summary of the current knowledge on the electrical characterization of filamentary DBDs. In particular, the recent new insights on the elementary volume and surface memory mechanisms in these discharges will be discussed. An outlook for the forthcoming challenges on research and development will be given.},

A characteristic feature of this novel sheath equation is an internal singularity of the saddle point type which separates the depletion-?eld dominated sheath part of the solution from the ambipolar diffusion-controlled plasma. The properties of this singularity allow us to de?ne, in a nonarbitrary way, a collisionally modi?ed Bohm criterion which recovers Bohm?s original expression in the collisionless limit but also remains meaningful when collisions are included. A comparison is made with the collisionally modi?ed Bohm criteria proposed by Godyak (1982 Phys. Lett. A 89 80), Valentini (1996 Phys. Plasmas 3 1459) and Chen (1997 Phys. Plasmas \textbackslash bf 5 804) as well as with the approaches of Riemann (1991 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. \textbackslash bf 24 493) and Franklin (2003 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. \textbackslash bf 36 2821), who argued that the de?nition of a collisionally de?ned Bohm criterion is not possible.}

Computations were made for a beryllium, carbon, and tungsten coated divertor plate, and for three edge plasma regimes. New data on tritium codeposition in beryllium was obtained with the tritium plasma experiment (TPE) facility. This shows codeposited HBe ratios of the order of 10\% for surface temperatures \$\textbackslash leq 300\$\textdegree C, beryllium thereby being similar to carbon in this respect. Hydrocarbon transport calculations show significant loss (10\textendash 20\%) of chemically sputtered carbon for detached conditions (\$Te \textbackslash approx 1\$ eV at the divertor), compared to essentially no loss (100\% redeposition) for higher temperature plasmas. Calculations also show a high, non-thermal, D-T molecular flux for detached conditions. Tritium codeposition rates for carbon are very high for detached conditions ( 20 g T/1000 s discharge), due to buildup of chemically sputtered carbon on relatively cold surfaces of the divertor cassette. Codeposition is lower ( 10X) for higher edge temperatures ( 8\textendash 30 eV) and is primarily due to divertor plate buildup of physically sputtered carbon. Peak net erosion rates for carbon are of the order of 30 cm/burn yr. Erosion and codeposition rates for beryllium are much lower than for carbon at detached conditions, but are similar to carbon for the higher temperatures. Both erosion and tritium codeposition are essentially nil for tungsten for the regimes studied.},

Erosion analysis is now focusing on a very low boundary temperature (\$\textbackslash leq 2\$ eV) 'detached plasma' regime for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Vertical Director design. Erosion and tritium codeposition calculations are made for this regime using a coupled WBC/REDEP/DEGAS+ code analysis. The analysis includes calculations of low energy, oblique incidence, sputtering yields using the VFTRIM-3D code calibrated to fit recent data on D-Be sputtering. We find that beryllium performs better than carbon for detached conditions due to the absence of chemical sputtering. Beryllium performs worse than vanadium or tungsten. Net erosion rates of beryllium coated first wall components, due mainly to physical sputtering by charge exchange D-T neutrals, vary from 0 to 2 cm per burn-year along the wall.

Both plasmas generated in confined geometries, so-called microplasmas, as well as discharge filaments occurring in commonly filamentary plasmas, e.g. microdischarges in dielectric barrier discharges are covered. In spite of the differences between microplasmas which often obtain a quasi steady-state and single microdischarges or filaments which are self-limited in space and time and thus intrinsically transient, both face very similar diagnostic challenges of which two are immediately apparent: the high collisionality which requires adaptations of standard plasmas diagnostics often developed for low-pressure plasmas, and the requirements on high spatial resolution due to the strong gradients in plasma properties. The complexity of the plasma generation and the physical and chemical properties of the above-mentioned plasmas requires the knowledge of an extensive series of different parameters to obtain a full characterization. As the results of the diagnostics are not always unambiguous and require a detailed understanding of plasma physics and chemistry, a summary of the main properties and pecularities of high-pressure plasmas is included in this review.},

In particular, the energy distribution of secondary particles and their influence on the ion beam deposition process of Ag was studied in dependence on process parameters. Energy-selective mass spectrometry was used to measure the energy distribution of sputtered and backscattered ions. The energy distribution of the sputtered particles shows, in accordance with theory, a maximum at low energy and an \textsuperscript{-2\$} decay for energies above the maximum. If the sum of incidence angle and polar emission angle is larger than 90\textdegree, additional contributions due to direct sputtering events occur. The energy distribution of the backscattered primary particles can show contributions by scattering at target particles and at implanted primary particles. The occurrence of these contributions depends again strongly on the scattering geometry but also on the primary ion species. The energy of directly sputtered and backscattered particles was calculated using equations based on simple two-particle-interaction whereas the energy distribution was simulated using the well-known Monte Carlo code TRIM.SP. In principal, the calculation and simulation data agree well with the experimental findings.}

  abstract = {There is an increasing demand for thin films with tailored properties, which requires the use and control of adequate deposition techniques. Ion beam sputter deposition (IBSD) is a physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique that is capable of fulfilling the technological challenges. In contrast to other PVD techniques, IBSD offers a unique opportunity to tailor the properties of the film-forming particles (sputtered target and scattered primary particles) and, hence, thin film properties. This is related to the fact that the generation and acceleration of the primary particles from the ion beam source, the generation of film-forming particles at the target, and thin film growth on the substrate are spatially separated. Thus, by changing ion beam parameters (ion species and ion energy) and geometrical parameters (ion incidence angle and emission angle), the energy distributions of the film-forming particles are modified. Even though in use for several decades, IBSD was not investigated systematically until lately. Utilizing the full potential of IBSD requires a comprehensive understanding of the physical processes. This tutorial describes the systematics of IBSD: The correlation between process parameters, properties of the film-forming particles, and thin film properties. The most important process parameters are the scattering geometry and the primary particle species. Depending on the material, different film properties can be influenced. Examples are adhesion, structural properties, composition, surface roughness, mass density, optical properties, stress, and electrical resistivity. In addition to the experimental results, fundamental physical aspects, experimental setups, and techniques for thin film deposition and particle characterization are described.},

First, a wider particle size range can be accessed. Second, the particle size distributions of the coated latexes are much narrower than those of the pure polypyrrole particles reported earlier. Preliminary studies confirm that, after charging and acceleration, these conducting polymer-coated latex particles have very similar mass-velocity profiles to those reported for colloidal iron particles in the hypervelocity literature.

The method is especially designed for astrophysical applications in that it treats economically and with moderate accuracy (+ or - 20\%) the dependences of alphaT and ft on finite and different surface and gas temperatures for a large number of gas-surface combinations. In particular, the method is applied to the astrophysical combinations of hydrogen and helium gases incident on graphite, silicon, and ice surfaces. Graphs are presented of the dependence of alphaT and ft on interstellar gas temperatures in the range of 10 to 10,000 K and grain temperatures in the range 10 to 1000 K, assuming the current estimates of the gas-surface physical parameters such as the composition and the Debye temperature of the grain material, the repulsive range of the surface potential, and the gas-grain adsorption energy.},

Technology demonstration satellites can be used as test bed to assess the influence of the plasma plume generated by an Electric thruster on spacecraft sub-systems and parts, throughout satellite operational lifetime. In Europe, The French satellite STENTOR (program supported by CNES) is specifically dedicated to the EP in-flight test and to the characterization of the possible plasma interactions induced by the operation on board of Hall Effect Thrusters (HET). In the frame of this program the use of a Plasma Diagnostic Package (PDP) suitable for the HET propulsion is envisaged. In this scenario LABEN Proel Tecnologie Division is completing the development and proto-qualification (under ALCATEL contract) of a PDP, light and compact (less than 1.3 kg, included the electronics), based on a Retarding Potential Analyzer RPA) and a Langmuir Probe (LP). The PDP allows the collection of experimental data on energy distribution of ions in the periphery of the plasma beam, of plasma parameters and of erosion/contamination issues (this latter measurement is in charge of probes external to the PDP, being the interface to these probes managed inside the PDP). This paper presents the architecture of the PDP, its performances and operation modes, as well as a general overview on mass, dimensions and power breakdowns. The last part of the paper addresses the most significant tests of the proto-qualification test campaign.}

It is shown that the pressure P and either the current density at low frequency J or the self-bias voltage lib at high frequency are the major macroscopic parameters controlling the deposition. The growth kinetics were studied and the mass deposition rate was found to be a quasi-linear function of P\^1/2. The effects of ion bombardment are related to the products V\_B P\^-1/2 (13.56 MHz) and JP\^-1/2 (50 kHz), the inverse square root dependence for the pressure arising from the quasilinear evolution of the sheath thickness with P\^-1/2. This ion bombardment results in film densification. The relations between structure, properties and ion fluxes will be reported in a forthcoming publication.}

Boron neutral 249.677 and 249.773 nm lines were measured using a high-resolution spectrometer. Spectral measurement results and the accompanying analysis and discussion are presented in this study. From the spectral measurements it was observed that the Boron emission intensity significantly increases for increased discharge voltage pointing to a large increase in the thruster wall erosion rate. Additionally, the measurements show that for the nominal discharge voltage and the applied magnetic field intensity, there is an optimum propellant flow rate for minimum Boron emission, thus minimum wall erosion rate. The variation in the current to the magnet coils showed that the Boron emission intensity increases for increased magnetic field and the Boron emission intensity shows similar behavior to that of the Xenon single ion emission line intensity at 248.911 nm. The findings of the study show that emission spectroscopy can be used in determining the optimum operational parameters for minimum wall erosion for SPT type Hall thrusters.},

While this instrument was developed for magnetized plasmas, the concept works for nonmagnetized plasmas as well. We have measured forces as small as \textsuperscript{-4\$} N on a surface immersed in the plasma where small forces are due to ionic and neutral particles with kinetic energies on the order of a few eV impacting the surface. This instrument, a force sensor, uses a target plate surface! that is immersed in the plasma and connected to one end of an alumina rod while the opposite end of the alumina rod is mechanically connected to a titanium beam on which four strain gauges are mounted. The force on the target generates torque, causing strain in the beam. The resulting strain measurements can be correlated to a force on the target plate. The alumina rod electrically and thermally isolates the target plate from the strain gauge beam and allows the strain gauges to be located out of the plasma flow while also serving as a moment arm of several inches to increase the strain in the beam at the strain gauge location. These force measurements correspond directly to momentum flux and may be used with known plasma conditions to place boundaries on the kinetic energies of the plasma and neutral particles. The force measurements may also be used to infer thrust produced by a plasma propulsive device. Stainless steel, titanium, molybdenum, and aluminum flat target plates have been used. Momentum flux measurements of H\_2, D\_2, He, and Ar plasmas produced in a magnetized plasma device have been performed.}

For the characterization of plasma sources, electrostatic probes are the easiest to use, but interpretation of the current-voltage (I-V) curves is not straightforward. The presence of strong RF pickup and neutral collisions further complicates the problem. Langmuir's orbital-motion-limited (OML) theory provides a simple formula for ion current, but this is not expected to be valid in high-density plasmas. With carefully designed probes, it is found experimentally that OML can be used successfully under adverse conditions. Careful examination of the OML theory shows that its validity is fortuitous but can give correct results in commonly encountered conditions. The probe design, results, caveats, and methodology are given for use of probes in RF plasmas.}

The aperture dimensions and array element spacings were assumed to be comparable with the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic field. The solution given can include the effect of a dielectric slab used to support the thin conducting sheet. The solution is obtained by matching the tangential field components at the surface of the screen. The resulting integral equation is solved by the method of moments which reduces the integral equation to a system of linear algebraic equations that can be solved with the use of a digital computer. Accurate results for both the magnitude and phase of the aperture field distribution and the transmission coefficients for the propagating modes are determined explicitly for a specific example of slots arranged in an equilateral triangular lattice. The balance of power flow between the reflected and the transmitted waves has been checked with satisfactory results. The solution can be applied to the problem of scattering from a conducting screen with periodic apertures and to the complementary problem of scattering from a set of conducting plates by the use of Babinet's principle.},

  abstract = {Commercial polymers in thin film form were used for modification by atmospheric RF plasma. The influence of the plasma treatments using Ar and ArqO2 on surface energy, morphology and chemical structure of the films was investigated. It was revealed that both modifications caused surface activation of the polymer film, but they obeyed different mechanisms enhancing polymer wettability. First, surface graphitization due to argon sputtering caused hydrogen to free the surface and then reacts with oxygen in the air. Second, surface oxidation is connected with the functional group formation. The reactions of Ti with the polymer led to the simultaneous formation of TiCl2, TiC, Ti-oxide and they contributed to film adhesion. In comparison with Ar, the mixed ArqO2 RF plasma treatment was a more timesaving process and had more influences on surface activation and film adhesion.},

  abstract = {Plasma treatment has been used in recent years to activate the surfaces of adhesive substrates and thus as an adhesion promoter between adhesive and substrates. The use of plasma treatments is widely adopted in the automotive industries especially for polymers that present low surface energy, such as polypropylene. In this work, polypropylene substrates used in the automotive industries have been treated with two different techniques: vacuum and atmospheric plasma. Then, polyurethane and methacrylate adhesives have been used to bond single lap joints (SLJs). Typically, these two adhesives cannot bond polypropylene substrates without surface treatments. An experimental plan has been designed to investigate the process parameters that can increase the functional polar groups (FPGs) maximizing the adhesion strength. Besides the types of plasma, two different gas carriers (air and nitrogen) and different treatment times have been investigated. The substrates, treated and not treated, have been assessed through scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy to quantitatively assess the increment of FPGs after the different treatments. The experimental plan shows that the atmospheric plasma can improve the surface of the substrates by using a smaller time. Mechanical tests on SLJs show that methacrylate and polyurethane cannot bond polypropylene substrates without the plasma treatment. On the other hand, the treated substrates can form a strong bonding with the adhesive since all SLJs exhibit a substrate failure. Mechanical tests have been also carried out after three different aging cycles showing that the adopted plasma treatment is not affected by the aging cycles.},

The momentum flux onto a biasable target plate is transferred via a suspended quartz tube onto a sensitive force transducer, a capacitance?type pressure gauge. This protects the transducer from thermal damage, arcing, and sputtering. An absolute force calibration of the PMM to 1\% accuracy has been made and is described. A flat carbon target has been used in measurements of the momentum flux of He, Ne, Ar, and Kr plasmas produced in a magnetized linear plasma device.}

This raises the question of whether there could exist an extension of the theory that removes this indeterminism, as suspected by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. Although this has been shown to be impossible, existing results do not imply that the current theory is maximally informative. Here we ask the more general question of whether any improved predictions can be achieved by any extension of quantum theory. Under the assumption that measurements can be chosen freely, we answer this question in the negative: no extension of quantum theory can give more information about the outcomes of future measurements than quantum theory itself. Our result has significance for the foundations of quantum mechanics, as well as applications to tasks that exploit the inherent randomness in quantum theory, such as quantum cryptography.}

In PSII, targets to be implanted are placed directly in a plasma source and then pulse biased to a high negative potential. A plasma sheath forms around the target and ions bombard the entire target simultaneously. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that PSII: (1) efficiently implants ions to concentrations and depths required for surface modification, (2) produces material with improved microhardness and wear properties, and (3) dramatically improves the life of manufacturing tools in actual industrial applications. For example, the tool life of M-2 pierce punches used to produce holes in mild steel plate has been increased by a factor of 80.}

This effect has been investigated experimentally in a recent article by Thomas Trottenberg, Thomas Richter, and Holger Kersten from Kiel University/Germany [Eur. Phys. J. D 69, 91 (2015)]. The experimental results are impressive and have actually drawn the attention of the community to an interesting question which so far has been largely ignored. In addition to their experimental results the Kiel group proposes also a rough concept in order to explain their findings which provides certainly a basic qualitative understanding of the physical processes involved. However, on a closer inspection the picture developed so far is not entirely satisfying and the problem seems to require a more fundamental approach. This comment shows that the effect of the wall pressure can be described exactly using only analytical methods. The physical situation is analyzed by three different approaches. First, the simple case of only one spatial dimension is presented in detail. Second, the case of spherical symmetry is analyzed by some simplifying assumptions in order to investigate the effect of higher dimensionality. Third, a formal derivation for arbitrary geometry is given. This general result includes the one-dimensional case but does not allow a convenient connection between the pressures at the wall and in the center. Finally, the results are summarized and some conclusions are drawn.},

  abstract = {If a temporally symmetric voltage waveform is applied to a capacitively coupled radio frequency (CCRF) discharge, that contains one or more even harmonics of the fundamental frequency, the sheaths in front of the two electrodes will necessarily be asymmetric even in a geometrically symmetric discharge. Optimally this is achieved with a dual-frequency discharge driven at a phase locked fundamental frequency and its second harmonic, e.g. 13.56 MHz and 27.12 MHz. An analytical model, a hybrid fluid/Monte-Carlo kinetic model as well as a Particle in Cell (PIC) simulation show that this Electrical Asymmetry Effect (EAE) leads to the generation of a DC self bias as a function of the phase between the applied voltage harmonics in geometrically symmetric as well as asymmetric discharges. The DC self bias depends almost linearly on the phase angle and the role of the electrodes (powered and grounded) can be reversed. At low pressures the EAE is self-amplifying due to the conservation of ion flux in the sheaths. By tuning the phase, precise and convenient control of the ion energy at the electrodes can be achieved, while the ion flux remains constant. The maximum ion energy can typically be changed by a factor of about three at both electrodes. At the same time the ion flux is constant within \$\textbackslash pm 5\$\%.},

  abstract = {A computationally assisted spectroscopic technique to measure secondary electron emission coefficients ({$\gamma$}-CAST) in capacitively-coupled radio-frequency plasmas is proposed. This non-intrusive, sensitive diagnostic is based on a combination of phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy and particle-based kinetic simulations. In such plasmas (under most conditions in electropositive gases) the spatio-temporally resolved electron-impact excitation/ionization rate features two distinct maxima adjacent to each electrode at different times within each RF period. While one maximum is the consequence of the energy gain of electrons due to sheath expansion, the second maximum is produced by secondary electrons accelerated towards the plasma bulk by the sheath electric field at the time of maximum voltage drop across the adjacent sheath. Due to these different excitation/ionization mechanisms, the ratio of the intensities of these maxima is very sensitive to the secondary electron emission coefficient {$\gamma$}. This sensitvity, in turn, allows {$\gamma$} to be determined by comparing experimental excitation profiles and simulation data obtained with various {$\gamma$}-coefficients. The diagnostic, tested here in a geometrically symmetric argon discharge, yields an effective secondary electron emission coefficient of for stainless steel electrodes.},

  abstract = {The ion-induced secondary electron emission coefficient ({$\gamma$}) is a vital parameter in the modeling of low temperature RF plasmas. Often, the value of {$\gamma$} drastically affects the electron power absorption dynamics, the plasma parameters and the quality of the separate control of ion flux and mean ion energy at the electrodes. Experimental results for {$\gamma$} under plasma exposure are difficult to obtain. Therefore, {$\gamma$} is either assumed to be a constant chosen with some uncertainty, or is approximated as a quantity that is a function of the ion energy and cleanliness of the electrode surface. It is hypothesized that these assumptions are not valid for all materials and plasma conditions. In this work, Hagstrum's theory on Auger emission is suggested as a robust, ab initio model for accurately predicting {$\gamma$} for metal surfaces with a wide range of surface conditions and for a variety of ion species. To demonstrate the effect of the choice of {$\gamma$} on modeling results, we carry out particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision simulations of 13.56 MHz, single-frequency argon and helium capacitive discharges. Simulations are run assuming that: (i) {$\gamma$} is a constant, (ii) {$\gamma$} is an energy and surface condition dependent quantity that is independent of the electrode material, and (iii) {$\gamma$} is obtained from the ab initio model for different clean metals. The energy distribution of the emitted electrons resulting from Hagstrum's theory is also implemented as a uniform, metal dependent distribution with physically accurate energy domain. It is found that this is important for some metals in both helium and argon. Lastly, it is observed that, depending on the assumed surface conditions, the plasma properties change dramatically. Based on these results we conclude that a realistic, material dependent implementation of {$\gamma$} is required to obtain realistic simulation results and that Hagstrum's model suits this purpose.},

Typically a few thousand anions are used for one nanoparticle. The resulting particle density and the charge on the particles are calculated with an iterative method. While the spatial distribution and the charge of the particles are influenced by the plasma, the presence of the nanoparticles will in turn influence the plasma properties. Several simulations with different particle radii are performed. The resulting density profile of the dust will greatly depend on the particle size, as it reacts to the shift of the balance of the different forces acting on the particles.}

Since the debye length was small compared with the probe radius, no ions or electrons were collected on the downstream part of a probe. The thruster was operated at a thrust level of 18 {$\pm$} 0.3 mN. Detailed results are given for ion flux profiles and ion density in the beam, as well as for floating potential profiles and degree of nonneutralization. Ion densities reach a maximum of 1.8 {$\pm$} 0.2 x 10\^10 cm\^-3 on the beam centerline at an axial distance of 15 {$\pm$} 0.3 cm from the acceleration grid.

The electron density then follows from letting the theoretical result for the characteristic coincide with the experimental one at a significantly larger voltage. Satisfactory agreement is obtained between theoretical and experimental curves. The results obtained for the electron density are compared with corresponding results for the ion density, determined from the ion saturation current. The ion density measurements are valid in the main ion beam, but not in the charge exchange plasma. The electron density measurements are valid in the charge exchange plasma and in the downstream part of the ion beam, but not in its upstream part.

For the nonmonoenergetic case, an analytical expression for the ion flux to the dust grain is obtained. It is studied how the dust charge and ion drag forces depend on the rf frequency, electron density at plasma-sheath boundary, electron temperature and ratio of the effective oscillation amplitude of rf current to the electron Debye length. It is shown that the dust charge and ion drag forces obtained in the monoenergetic ion approximation may differ from those calculated assuming that the ions are nonmonoenergetic. The difference increases with increasing the width of the ion energy spread in the ion distribution.}

  abstract = {The shielding effectiveness of a rectangular enclosure, with one wall as a grid, is studied in detail. An approximate technique is used: the holes of the grid are replaced by concentrated magnetic dipoles and the inside of the enclosure is regarded as a piece of a waveguide with only the lowest TE10-mode present. This allows the construction of a simple equivalent circuit, from which the shielding effectiveness can be quickly deduced. This simple model has been checked against dedicated experiments, proving its validness even above the first resonance frequency of the empty enclosure},

Convergence of the approximations is checked by computing the properties of fully ionized hydrogen and of several other mixtures where the molecules interact with inverse-power repulsive potentials. From the results for hydrogen, it is seen that at least the third approximation should be used for the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusion coefficient, and the second approximation for the electrical conductivity and viscosity of ionized gases. These results contrast with those for un-ionized gases where one lower level of approximation is generally adequate.}

The self-consistent coupling of the equations is achieved by determining the material properties of the plasma from the dispersion relation of right-hand circularly polarized waves propagating parallel to the external magnetic field.

Hence, ion beam pulses with a length of 10 ?s to 18 ms can be applied without changing the other beam properties, which was proved by integrated and time-resolved measurements. The pulsed ion beam was utilised for the investigation of the GaAs etching by chlorine. The dynamics of halogen?solid interactions could be studied under real processing conditions by varying the pulse length. In general, the etch rate of GaAs increases with decreasing pulse length at a given pulse frequency as a result of the increased chloride coverage of the surface. The usage of pulsed ion beams from broad beam ion sources is proposed to control and improve the etch profiles, the defect density and the selectivity of reactive etch processes.},

Polystyrene macroions of 51 000 weight-average amu tend to form dimers and trimers in the beam while larger polystyrene macroions of 411 000 weight-average amu appear mostly to be multiply charged single species. The results demonstrate that definite mass/charge states can be formed by the electrospray technique, that a considerable monochromatization of macroion velocities in the beam takes place, and that the macroions become highly concentrated relative to low-molecular-weight solvent and nitrogen ions during the transit time in the supersonic beam.}

A finite element model is used to examine the flow potential distribution in a truncated bounded region close to the spherical cavity. In order to give an appropriate artificial boundary condition at the truncated boundary, a transient infinite element, that is developed to describe transient flow in the exterior unbounded domain, is coupled with the finite element model. The coupling procedure of the finite and infinite elements at their interface is described by means of the boundary integro-differential equation rather than through a matrix approach. Consequently, a Neumann boundary condition can be applied at the truncated boundary to ensure the C1-continuity of the solution at the truncated boundary. Numerical analyses indicate that the proposed finite element-infinite element coupling approach can generate a correct artificial truncated boundary condition to the finite element model for the unbounded flow transport problem.},

  abstract = {Absolute densities of nitrous species were studied in an atmospheric pressure RF plasma jet. The measurement of NO and N2O densities has been performed mainly by means of ex situ quantum-cascade laser absorption spectroscopy via a multi-pass cell in Herriot configuration. The dependence of the species' production on individual parameters such as power, flow and oxygen, nitrogen and water admixture is shown. NO and N2O densities are found to increase with absorbed power, while an increase in the gas flow induces a decrease of these densities due to a reduction in residence time of the gas in the plasma. Actually, a change of these two parameters, absorbed power and gas flow, induces a variation of energy density. The higher energy density, the higher NO and N2O densities. The NO and N2O densities are strongly gas mixture dependent. A change of that parameter allows to choose between a NO-rich or a N2O-rich regime. NO and N2O densities increase as a function of the N2 admixture, while increasing oxygen, above a minimum value, reduces the densities of both NO and N2O. When adding water instead of oxygen to the gas mixture the reduction in the NO density is much less. For maximal NO and N2O formation a ratio of about He/N2/O2\,\,=\,\,99.5/0.36/0.07 is found to be the most efficient in the {$\mu$}-APPJ. However, it was found that the absorbed power in the plasma always reduces with increasing admixtures. The validation of the results obtained with quantum-cascade absorption spectroscopy with mass spectrometry shows how the two measurement techniques can complement each other. Finally a comparison of our results and others works is presented.},

  title = {Plasma Jets for Life Science Applications: Characterisation and Tuning of the Reactive Species Composition},
  author = {D{\"u}nnbier, Mario},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to concentrate on the investigation of these ROS\&RNS composition distribution and their production pathways in the gas phase produced by a plasma jet. By understanding the physical mechanisms behind the generation of the ROS\&RNS a precise tuning and design of the composition distribution in the gas phase can be achieved. One crucial physical parameter is the dissipated power inside the plasma. Only if this parameter is known a meaningful comparison of different feed gas settings is possible. Therefore, a concept for measuring the dissipated power inside the plasma for the modified micro-scaled atmospheric pressure plasma jet( \textmu APPJ) is designed. Additionally, due to achievements within this thesis it is now possible to ignite a homogeneous discharge in argon and helium within the geometry of the \textmu APPJ. The used feed gas is a determining factor concerning the electron energy distribution function and consequently influencing the production mechanism of the ROS\&RNS. First of all, the electrical characterisation of the modified \textmu APPJ was performed including the alpha-to-gamma transition. It is shown that the alpha-to-gamma transition power is increasing with increasing frequency. For the first time it is now feasible to investigate the influence of the dissipated power on the neutral gas temperature, the metastable atom densities and the ROS\&RNS production for the modified \textmu APPJ with argon and helium as feed gas. Due to the possibility of changing the feed gas and controlling the dissipated power a fundamental insight into the production mechanism of the ROS\&RNS generated by the plasma jet is achieved. With rising dissipated power the temperature and the metastable densities as well as the ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentrations are increasing. By adding molecular oxygen and nitrogen to the feed gas of a plasma jet the ROS\&RNS composition can be tuned. However, also the dissipated power is changed by the small amount of admixtures. Due to the developed dissipated power measurements within this thesis it was possible to disentangle the influence of the admixture on the power and on the ROS\&RNS production. If the dissipated power is fixed for the \textmu APPJ with argon and helium feed gas, respectively, the highest amount of ozone was measured with oxygen admixture in an argon discharge, the highest amount of dinitrogen pentoxide with nitrogen admixture in an argon discharge and the highest amount of nitrogen dioxide with nitrogen admixture in a helium discharge. Beyond the influence of the dissipated power and the molecular admixture on the ROS\&RNS production the feed gas temperature is a crucial parameter for the corresponding chemical reactions. By changing this parameter the distribution of ozone and nitrogen dioxide can be tuned precisely in such a way that with increasing temperature the ozone density goes down and the nitrogen dioxide density rises. Another determinant for the ROS\&RNS composition produced by an atmospheric pressure plasma jet is the influence of ambient air. If the ambient air is changing from pure nitrogen to pure oxygen atmosphere the ozone density produced by the plasma jet is increasing. For the same conditions the nitrogen dioxide has a maximum at an oxygen-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. To avoid the influence of the ambient air on the reactive species production the afterglow of the \textmu APPJ was prolonged with a glass tube. By increasing the amount of molecular admixtures to the feed gas with each in equal quantities a totally different ROS\&RNS composition can be obtained compared without the glass tube. It figures out that for small molecular admixtures the reactive species composition is nitrogen dominated and for higher admixtures it is oxygen dominated. Consequently, by shielding the ambient air from the active effluent and by admixing molecular oxygen and nitrogen the ROS\&RNS composition can be designed.},

Such materials can be found in an enormous variety of places, ranging from the powders used to make vitamin pills to the rings of Saturn, from beaches to grain elevators, and from pottery clay to interstellar dust. Granular materials have interested physicists from Coulomb and Faraday to Reynolds and Rayleigh, but only recently have mathematical and experimental methods been developed to analyze their properties in detail. This text develops the fundamental physics of the behavior of granular materials. It covers the basic properties of flow, friction, and fluidization of uniform granular materials; discusses mixing and segregation of heterogeneous materials (the famous "brazil-nut problem"); and concludes with an introduction to numerical models. The presentation begins with simple experiments and uses their results to build concepts and theorems about materials whos16e behavior is often quite counter-intuitive; it aims to present in a unified way the background needed to understand current work in the field. Developed for students at the University of Paris, the text will be suitable for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students; it should also be of interest to researchers and engineers just eentering the field.}

The plasma generates many harmonics on the fundamental, the first few being strongest. This gives a multi-harmonic rf voltage across the probe sheath that is removed by applying a rf signal to the probe that is matched both in amplitude and in phase for each harmonic. The probe I-V characteristic can then be analysed using dc theory. We show here that only when the rf harmonic amplitude approaches about 2Te is it necessary to compensate for that harmonic. For the commercial processing rig used this only occurs for the second harmonic at low pressures, {$<$} 5\texttimes 10-3 mbar. Here the addition of second-harmonic compensation shifts the probe I-V curve, making it markedly more positive than for fundamental-only compensation. Despite this the values obtained for the electron density ne and temperature Te changed by less than 10\%. For most plasmas in which the harmonics have amplitudes below Te the use of fundamental-only compensation is adequate for all but the most precise measurements.}

Its knowledge is a dominant setscrew for many processes such as controllable fluxes and energies of charged particles onto surfaces and for the electron energy distribution function. However, experimental data of electric field strengths in micro-structured surface dielectric barrier discharges are rare. Due to geometric configurations and dimensions in micrometer scale, probe-based investigations are challenging. To tackle these issues, we exploit the optical access into micro cavities of a plasma array operated with pure helium to use the Stark effect of the allowed 492.19 nm and forbidden 492.06 nm helium line . Based on it, we present spatially-integrated and time-resolved electric field strengths in a range between 20 kV cm-1 and 60 kV cm-1 depending on various parameters such as cavity diameters in 100 {$\mu$}m range and excitation properties. The obtained electric fields can be controlled just by bipolarity of applied voltage and show a good agreement to previous simulated field strengths in pore and silicon-based devices. As expected from simulation dealing with discharges in pores, a smaller cavity dimension yields higher electric field strengths. Due to these high electric fields and the option of this plasma source to easily integrate a catalyst in the discharge volume, this micro cavity plasma array promises further insights into plasma-enhanced catalysis.},

  abstract = {Sputtering is caused by a series of atomic collisions between the incident projectiles and target atoms and between the target atoms themselves. These collision cascades can be followed with computer programs and with the Boltzmann transport equation. The two main approaches with computer programs are the binary collision approximation (BCA) and molecular dynamics (MD); they are both based on classical dynamics. Programs based on BCA describe sputtering by a sequence of independent binary collisions between atoms, whereas MD simulates the time evolution of the multiple interaction of each moving atom with all the atoms in some surrounding. The BCA approach can be regarded to be based on 'sequential event logic', whereas the MD approach is based on 'multiple interaction logic' according to Harrison [1]. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages [2, 3].}

Here, the effluent of a He/O2 microplasma jet has been analyzed in a helium and in an air atmosphere by molecular beam mass spectrometry. First, the composition of the effluent in air was recorded as a function of the distance to determine how fast air admixes into the effluent. Then, the spatial distribution of atomic oxygen and ozone in the effluent was recorded in ambient air and compared with measurements in a helium atmosphere. Additionally, a fluid model of the gas flow with reaction kinetics of reactive oxygen species in the effluent was constructed. In ambient air, the O density declines only slightly faster with distance compared with a helium atmosphere. In contrast, the O3 density in ambient air increases significantly faster with distance compared with a helium atmosphere. This unexpected behavior cannot be explained by simple recombination reactions of O atoms with O2 molecules. A reaction scheme involving the reaction of plasma-produced excited O{${_\ast}$}2 species of unknown identity with ground state O2 molecules is proposed as a possible explanation for these observations.},

Parts I and II contained compilations of experimental data on ionic mobilities and diffusion coefficients (both longitudinal and transverse) for ions in neutral gases (almost exclusively at room temperature) in an externally applied field. The data were tabulated as a function of the ionic energy parameter E/N, where E is the electric field intensity and N is the number density of the gas. The coverage of the literature extended up to about August 1978. The criteria for selection of the mobility and diffusion data were (1) the measurements must cover a reasonably wide range of E/N, (2) the identity of the ions must be well established, and (3) the accuracy of the data must be good. Recent important development in the transport theory of gaseous ions were outlined, and utilized to derive quantities from the experimental data that are useful in various applications. The present paper (Part III) extends all aspects of Parts I and II into 1983. In addition, here we compile zero-field mobilities as a function of the gas temperature, zero-field mobilities at fixed gas temperatures, and ratios of the transverse diffusion coefficient to the mobility as a function of E/N. In this compilation we include some experimental data obtained without mass spectrometric selection of the ions, but only in cases where there is little or no uncertainty about the identity of the ions and no confusion related to ion-molecule reactions on the part of the drifting ions.},

The usual way to measure ion distribution functions by those analyzers is to change the reference potential of the analyzer thereby scanning the distribution function. For interpreting measured ion distribution functions we describe the principle of such a combined ion mass and energy analyzer and calculate the measured ion current and its relation to the ion distribution function. In this way, we show that the measured ion current versus the reference potential of the energy analyzer represents a velocity distribution function versus energy. Furthermore, we discuss in how far it is possible to evaluate from this velocity distribution function the total ion current densities and the energy carried by the ions onto a surface exposed to plasma.

Ion energy distribution was measured by use of a retarding field energy analyzer connected to a computer controlled data acquisition system. Influence of working conditions on the average ion energy and on the ion energy spread in the beam is described. Energy spread has typical values between 8 and 25 eV. Average ion energy can change due to variations of ion source working conditions (at constant extraction voltages) up to 60 eV. Increase of both the average ion energy and ion energy spread is observed with increasing rf power coupled to the plasma (20-100 W). This correlates to the increasing amplitude of plasma floating potential oscillation. Average ion energy decreasesw ith increasingm agnetic induction (O-75 mT) and with increasing pressure in the vacuum chamber (2 X 10\^-4-1.8 X 10\^-3 mbar) due to decreasing cathode oscillation amplitudes. Average ion energy decreases with increasing distance from the broad beam axis because of chromatical and spherical aberrations of the source extraction optics. Multiple peaks in the ion energy spectrum are observed. Their occurrence can be explained by charge exchange effects in the rf oscillating plasma sheath.}

The high degree of accuracy achieved in the experimental determination of the law of motions of droplets through gases, makes a careful theoretical examination of the problem desirable. Assuming the usual Maxwellian distribution of velocities in the gas, the force exerted by the impinging molecules is found to be M where M=(4?/3) Nma2cmV, N, m, a, and cm being the number per unit volume, mass, radius, and mean speed of the molecules and V the speed of the droplet. The force exerted by the molecules leaving the surface depends on how they leave. (1) For uniform evaporation from the whole surface, the force is -M; (2) for specular reflection of all the impinging molecules, -M; (3) for diffuse reflection with unchanged distribution of velocities, -(13/9)M; (4) for diffuse reflection with the Maxwell distribution corresponding to the effective temperature of the part of the surface they come from, -(1+9?/64)M, for a non-conducting droplet (4a), and -(1+?/8)M, for a perfectly conducting droplet (4b). Cases (1) and (2) can not be distinguished experimentally, but (2) is more probable physically. The experimental values agree with 1/10 specular reflection, case (2), and 9/10 diffuse reflection, case (4a) or (4b). For large values of l/a, the droplet behaves like a perfect conductor, case (4b). (2) Comparatively large spheres. The distribution of velocities is no longer Maxwellian because of the hydrodynamic stresses which can not now be neglected. The new law is derived (Eq. 47). The conditions at the surface of the sphere are discussed and it is shown that the diffusely reflected molecules have a Maxwellian distribution corresponding to the temperature and density of the gas, just as though they were reflected with conservation of velocity (specularly). The assumptions of Bassett are theoretically justified and a complete confirmation is obtained for the correction factor for Stokes' law [1+0.7004 (2/s-1) (l/a)] on which Millikan's conclusions are based, especially as to the percentage of specular reflection. (3) Rotating spheres are also considered in an appendix, and the values of the resistance are derived for various cases.}

  abstract = {Atmospheric pressure non-equilibrium (cold) plasma jet technology received enormous attention in surface processing of materials in the last two decades, and still continues nowadays to attract growing interest. In addition to the advantages of the atmospheric pressure operation such as the potential cost reduction of apparatuses as well as their easier handling and maintenance, due to the distinctive remote operation, plasma jets give the unique possibility of placing the substrate outside the source boundaries. Consequently, the processing of complex three-dimensional objects and the integration into existing production lines are expected to be much easier. However, while appealing, plasma jet technology has the drawback that great efforts are required for process optimization, since many factors can affect, for instance, the physical and chemical proprieties of the so-called ``plasma plume'' emanating from the devices and propagating in open space towards the substrate to be treated. The aim of this paper is to provide a critical literature review on the utilization of atmospheric pressure non-equilibrium plasma jets in surface processing of materials. Starting from the description and classification of the multitude of devices used in this applicative field so far, the attention will be drawn on some very important aspects to be taken into account in process optimization. The discussion will be focused on basic concepts and peculiarities closely related to the remote operation of the plasma sources, which include the characteristics and dynamics of the plasma plume interacting with the substrate and the surrounding atmosphere. Since the plasma jet approach allows the surface modification of small localized regions of the sample, the strategies implemented to enlarge the treated area will be also addressed. Finally, a brief overview will be given of the available applications and recent developments in the field of etching, thin film deposition and treatment.},

Analyzers are grouped into two classifications: 1) mirror-type analyzers, and 2) deflector-type analyzers. Common mirror-type analyzers are the parallel-plate mirror analyzer and the cylindrical mirror analyzer. For deflector-type analyzers, a generalized toroidal type is first described and the commonly used cylindrical deflector and spherical deflector analyzers are discussed as special cases. The procedure for energy resolution calculations of electrostatic analyzers is described, which is a common way of comparing analyzers. Ion energy distributions from a spherical deflector analyzer are presented, comparing variations in 1) particle energy, 2) particle angle, 3) the entrance and exit geometry of the analyzer, and 4) sector angle using numerical calculations.},

When either v\_0 or E\_0 is sufficiently large, however, the exact solution may differ appreciably from the Child-Langmuir law. The existence of a closed-form expression for the spatial variation of the sheath potential is shown to be contingent upon the satisfaction of a simple inequality relating v\_0 and E\_0 to J. When v\_0 obeys the Bohm criterion and the magnitude of E\_0 suggests that the Bohm energy is acquired over a distance not less than one Debye length, this inequality is indeed satisfied.}

We show that \$\textbackslash kappa(z)\$ is determined by basic sheath parameters, such as the ion-to-neutral-species-mass ratio m/M, the mean free paths \$\textbackslash lambda\_e\$ and \$\textbackslash lambda\_c\$ for elastic scattering and charge transfer, and the ion distribution \$f\_0(v) = f(v,0)\$ at the presheath-sheath boundary.

  abstract = {Ion beam sputter deposition (IBD) provides intrinsic features which influence the properties of the growing film, because ion properties and geometrical process conditions generate different energy and spatial distribution of the sputtered and scattered particles. A vacuum deposition chamber is set up to measure the energy and spatial distribution of secondary particles produced by ion beam sputtering of different target materials under variation of geometrical parameters (incidence angle of primary ions and emission angle of secondary particles) and of primary ion beam parameters (ion species and energies). A representative set of Ag thin films is deposited arranged on a substrate holder equatorial to the Ag target in steps of 10\textdegree{} and characterized concerning their film thickness by profilometry to determine the angular distribution of the sputtered particles. The film thickness distributions show a tilted, cosine-like shape and a shifting of the maximum position depending on the primary particle energy and incidence angle of the primary ions. The energy distributions of sputtered and scattered ions and of sputtered neutrals are measured with an energy-selective mass spectrometer. The average energy of the sputtered ions increases with increasing emission angle and also increases with increasing incidence angle of the primary ions. In contrast, the average energy of the sputtered ions is nearly unaffected by the primary particle energy and particle species. The energy distribution of the scattered Ar ions reveals high energetic maxima which shift with increasing emission angle to higher energies. These maxima are not observed for Xe bombardment. The total energies of sputtered and scattered ions show significant differences between the two bombarding species. The maximum of the energy distribution of sputtered Ag neutrals is used to conclude on the surface binding energy of Ag (2.72 eV). All experimental data are compared with Monte Carlo simulations done with the well-known TRIM.SP.},

Specificity for acetylene was higher than in prior work. Improvements in conversion efficiency, yield, and specificity were due primarily to improved injector design and reactant mixing, and minimization of temperature gradients and cold boundary layers. At the 60-kilowatt scale cooling by wall heat transfer appears to be sufficient to quench the product stream and prevent further reaction of acetylene resulting in the formation of heavier hydrocarbon products or solid carbon. Significantly increasing the quenching rate by aerodynamic expansion of the products through a converging\textendash diverging nozzle led to a reduction in the yield of ethylene but had little effect on the yield of other hydrocarbon products. While greater product selectivity for acetylene has been demonstrated, the specific energy consumption per unit mass of acetylene produced was not improved upon.

Single photon counting is applied to resolve the time dependence. The transition to the gamma or secondary electron dominated state is observed directly in space and time dependent excitation of the helium ion level. The effect of the extreme lowering of the electron temperature resulting from the non-local sustaining mechanism is observed in the light of atomic helium lines, which show substantial differences between the singlet and the triplet systems due to spin changing collisions (singlet to triplet) coupling the metastable levels. The cross section of these collisions increases with a decrease of electron temperature below the threshold value of 0.79 eV.

We go back to the earliest works quoting them, where appropriate, to understand what those who introduced the various terms associated with the structure of the plasma\textendash sheath had in mind. We try to bring out the essence of the insights that have been gained subsequently, by quoting from the literature selectively, indicating how misunderstandings have arisen. In order to make it accessible to the generality of those currently working in low temperature plasmas we have sought to avoid mathematical complexity but retain physical insight, quoting from published work where appropriate. Nevertheless, in clarifying my own ideas I have found it necessary to do additional original work in order to give a consistent picture. In this way I have sought to bring together work in the late 1920s, the 1960s, and now mindful of the commercial importance of plasma processing, work over the past 15 years that adds to the general understanding.}

The surface analysis was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and surface profilometry which showed a dramatic increase in the content of oxygen functionalities and surface roughness after long-time Ar/O2-plasma treatment. For the plasma diagnostics, two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy was applied. The obtained etching mass as well as the surface roughness for different molecular oxygen admixtures revealed a strong dependence on the atomic-oxygen density. Furthermore, the radial surface profile, affected by plasma etching, might be attributed to the distribution of plasma-generated oxygen species in the plasma jet effluent.},

The electrochemical characteristics are very sensitive to the nature of the polymer, its content, and location. The presence of surface polymer hinders Li insertion in these materials (by comparison to materials without surface polymer) and appears to result in the partial entrapment of Li ions. For modified [PANI],VV2O,, polymer incorporation results in better reversibility and increased Li capacity in the nanocomposite. [PPY]\_0,40V\_2O\_5 displays a greater first discharge capacity than the respective PANI material, but is not as cyclable as in O,-[PANI]\_0.40V\_2O\_5. 0\_2-treatment results in the reformation of a high-potential Li site that is lost during the reductive intercalative polymerization. Li chemical diffusion coefficients are greater for the O\_2-[PANI]V\_2O\_5 nanocomposite than the xerogel by one order of magnitude, resulting in better performance at high current densities.

A reaction chemistry set for an argon/humid air mixture is developed, which considers 84 different species and 1880 reactions. Additionally, we present a reduced chemistry set, useful for higher level computational models. Calculated species density profiles along the plasma jet are shown and the chemical pathways are explained in detail. It is demonstrated that chemically reactive H, N, O and OH radicals are formed in large quantities after the nozzle exit and H2, O2(1{$\Delta$}g), O3, H2O2, NO2, N2O, HNO2 and HNO3 are predominantly formed as `long living' species.

Description is made of a feedback network which is used to stabilize rf potentials and plasma parameters over periods of several hours. The calibration of a focused X-band microwave interferometer indicates that the presence of the Pyrex plasma container has no noticeable effect on the electron density deduced from phase-shift measurements. At a pressure of 0.7 Torr in argon, space-resolved electron temperatures, deduced from symmetrical and asymmetrical double-probe I-V characteristics, indicate that the electron temperature is radially constant in the plasma column, and has a value which is 25\% higher than that predicted by using the von Engel and Steenbeck theory for a similar positive column. The radially integrated charge density profile, deduced from the probe ion current using the collisionless Laframboise theory, agrees within 15\% with that estimated from measurements made with a microwave interferometer. Collision-dominated probe theories are also considered and found to be less applicable.}

A design based on flexural pivots and electrostatic forces (for calibration and active damping) makes it possible to test thrusters with a mass of a few kilograms, and measure submicroNewton level forces with high accuracy and a resolution better than 0.03 {$\mu$}N. The usefulness of the balance is proved by measuring the performance of two different electric propulsion accelerators: a colloid thruster generating thrust in the 2\textendash 13 {$\mu$}N range, and a micropulsed plasma thruster yielding single impulse bits of \$19 \textbackslash mu\$Ns. The low noise figure of the balance (below \$0.1 \textbackslash muN / \textbackslash sqrt(Hz)\$ in the 7 mHz\textendash 1 Hz bandwidth) will make it possible to measure the thrust noise requirements imposed in colloid thrusters by missions such as the Space Technology 7 and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the performance of a fully-integrated MEMS planar electrospray thruster array operating in the pure ion-emission regime. Electrospray thrusters work by electrostatically extracting and accelerating ions or charged droplets from a liquid surface to produce thrust. Emission occurs from sharp emitter tips, which enhance the electric field and constrain the emission location. Electrospray propulsion is desirable for its simplicity, high thrust efficiency and tunable specific impulse. However, the electrospray process limits the thrust from a single tip. Consequently, achieving millinewton thrust levels requires an array with tens of thousands of emitters. We have used silicon batch microfabrication technology to make an array of 502 emitters in a 113 mm\^2 area. The thruster, weighing 5 g, was tested with the ionic liquid EMI-BF4, and was previously shown to operate in the pure ion-emission regime, with a total thrust of up to 13 {$\mu$}N and a 3000 s specific impulse. Typical operating ranges are from 500 V to 2000 V. Imprints taken by firing the emitter array against a target show all the emitters operating. Emission non-uniformities occur with a wavelength of a few emitter spacings, compatible with fabrication non-uniformities, but not with competition between neighboring emitters. Temperature-dependent current-voltage characteristics are reported which could be explained by Iribarne-Thompson ion evaporation directly from the liquid surface without formation of a Taylor cone. This emission regime had not been hypothesized heretofore.}

And the second part, where a selection of the results obtained as a part of my PhD studies are presented in the form of peer-reviewed publications which are organized according to the measurement method and type of investigated system. Additional to the relevant theory, the introductory part includes a chapter about the optimization of the passive thermal probe design and a detailed analysis of the calibration procedure. This part and the detailed description of the passive thermal probe are included, to point out some of the pitfalls that are encountered when working with thermal probes and give the reader insights into the details of this seemingly simple diagnostic method.},

Measurements of Stark spectra were made in the sheath region of a glow discharge using laser optogalvanic spectroscopy.

The gas temperature, NO density and the emission measurements are carried out both time and spatially resolved. The atmospheric pressure plasma jet has the advantage that the plasma dissipated power can be measured, and it was found that the gas temperature depends on the power, rather than the gas mixture. The NO density increases with increasing plasma power, and was found to have a maximum around 1.5 \texttimes{} 1021 m-3 at an air admixture of 2\%. The N2 C emission is modulated by the 13.9 MHz RF frequency, while the NO A emission front increases with much slower velocity during the 20 kHz duty cycle, which gives an insight into the excitation mechanisms in the plasma. Through the addition of either N2 or O2 to the plasma it was experimentally confirmed that the production of atomic N radicals are of key importance for the NO production in this atmospheric pressure plasma jet.},

The plasma process was applied to four unsaturated monomers: styrene C8H8, benzene C6H6, ethylene C2H4 and acetylene C2H2. The remote mass spectrometer location restricted species identification to neutral closed-shell molecules in their respective plasmas. Among the peaks in the mass spectra, those directly due to neutrals produced in the plasma were determined following a successful two-step methodology. Firstly, the use of low electron impact energy limited the fragmentation and strongly simplified the cracking patterns. Secondly, attribution of peaks directly due to neutrals was confirmed or ruled out by systematically measuring their appearance potential. In the case of styrene, not less than 48 new molecules were detected. The discussion of the observed stable by-products in each discharge suggested several radicals responsible for their production. Comparing the set of species among the four plasmas showed that the repeated addition of intermediates with one or two carbon atoms and with low H content dominated the chemistry. Under our conditions of intermediate to high W/FM (power over mass flow ratio), the gas-phase plasma polymerization then preferentially occurred through significant fragmentation and recombination. Finally, the measured appearance potentials during plasma provided estimation for the threshold ionization energy of several highly unsaturated hydrocarbons, useful for modeling.},

The DLC films are deposited in low pressure radio frequency (RF) discharges operating at 13.3Pa with methane as the source gas. The discharge is characterized in situ for the negative direct current (d.c.) self-bias voltage at the powered electrode, the average discharge current, and the total power, from which the average ion energy and average incident momentum flux can be determined. Ion energies explored in this study range from 50 to 250eV. Films are deposited on [100] n-type silicon wafers and are characterized by a variety of analytical methods to determine film hardness, density, and stress. It is shown that the maximum film density (1.7g/cm3) and hardness (18GPa) correspond to conditions of maximum deposition rate (5\texttimes 10-6g/s) and maximum film stress (1.8GPa) all at ion energies of approximately 160eV. These values are comparable with those previously reported in the literature.

  abstract = {Sputtering is caused by a series of atomic collisions between the incident projectiles and target atoms and between the target atoms themselves. These collision cascades can be followed with computer programs and with the Boltzmann transport equation. The two main approaches with computer programs are the binary collision approximation (BCA) and molecular dynamics (MD); they are both based on classical dynamics. Programs based on BCA describe sputtering by a sequence of independent binary collisions between atoms, whereas MD simulates the time evolution of the multiple interaction of each moving atom with all the atoms in some surrounding. The BCA approach can be regarded to be based on 'sequential event logic', whereas the MD approach is based on 'multiple interaction logic' according to Harrison [1]. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages [2, 3].}

With increasing gas pressure an abrupt transition to a high-temperature mode was found. The low-temperature mode and the observed transition are attributed to a change from stochastic to collisional electron heating enhanced by the Ramsauer effect.}

Measurements were made in a 13.56-MHz capacitive argon rf discharge at two gas pressures: p=0.03 Torr, where stochastic electron heating is dominant, and p=0.3 Torr, where collisional electron heating dominates. Thus, the measured EEDF at each gas pressure manifests a distinct departure from thermodynamic equilibrium being bi-Maxwellian at 0.03 Torr and Druyvesteyn-like at 0.3 Torr. Considerable differences in electron density and temperature were obtained from the different parts of the probe characteristic and these values differ dramatically in many cases from those found from integration of the measured EEDF's, thus demonstrating that using standard procedures in non-Maxwellian plasma can give misleading results.}

This section includes a description of correct probe design, the influence of circuit resistance, ion current and plasma oscillations and probe-surface effects on measurements. At present, the Druyvesteyn method is the most developed, consistent and routine way to measure the EDF. The following section of the review describes an extension of the classical EDF measurements into higher pressures, magnetic fields and anisotropic plasmas. To date, these methods have been used by a very limited number of researchers. Therefore, their verification has not yet been fully completed, and their reliable implementation still requires additional research. Nevertheless, the described methods are complemented by appropriate examples of measurements demonstrating their potential value.}

By detecting the fluorescence while scanning the laser frequency, a line shape was recorded that had two peaks, due to the Doppler shift from the incident and reflected beams. The separation of the peaks yielded an absolutely calibrated measure of the ion drift velocity, while the height of the peaks gave the ion density. As expected, in the sheath the measured ion density was lower and the velocity was higher than in this plasma. Using these measurements, it was confirmed that the ion flux is conserved in a sheath. The spatial profiles of ion velocity and density in the sheath were used to test a time-independent two-fluid theory, and good agreement was found. The data were also compared to Child's law, which showed good agreement near the electrode but predicted the density poorly, as expected, near the plasma-sheath boundary.}

The velocity resolution of the set-up is based on the pulsed laser-induced fluorescence technique, i.e., scanning the narrow bandwidth dye laser radiation over the Doppler broadened absorption profile of the sputtered particles. The arrangement of the vacuum vessel and fluorescence detection optics provides the means for an independent selection of the observed emission direction and the angle of incidence. A pulsed ion gun is applied to bombard the target with noble gas ions in the energy range between 200 and 500 eV. The target assembly allows the preparation of thin metal films by evaporation on optically polished glass substrates without break of the vacuum. We report on measurements obtained with this arrangement, i.e., the determination of energy distributions of sputtered aluminum atoms. The bombardment at both the normal and the oblique incidence of the ion beam are contained in the investigation. Pronounced anisotropic effects are observed in both cases. In the case of oblique bombardment the shape of the distributions reflects cascade effects as well as single collision properties. The energy distribution is approximated with the aid of an energy spectrum involving a superposition of exponential functions.

However, the COST-Jet design including precise electrical probes now offers the stability and reproducibility to create equi-operational plasmas in helium as well as in argon. In this publication, we compare fundamental plasma parameters and physical processes inside the COST reference microplasma jet, a capacitively coupled RF atmospheric pressure plasma jet, under operation in argon and in helium. Differences already observable by the naked eye are reflected in differences in the power-voltage characteristic for both gases. Using an electrical model and a power balance, we calculated the electron density and temperature at 0.6 W to be , 1.2 eV and , 1.7 eV for argon and helium, respectively. In case of helium, a considerable part of the discharge power is dissipated in elastic electron-atom collisions, while for argon most of the input power is used for ionization. Phase-resolved optical emission spectroscopy reveals differently pronounced heating mechanisms. Whereas bulk heating is more prominent in argon compared to helium, the opposite trend is observed for sheath heating. This also explains the different behavior observed in the power-voltage characteristics.},

Many plasma sources of diverse design have been proposed for these applications, but the relationship between source characteristics and application performance is not well-understood, and indeed many sources are poorly characterized. This circumstance is an impediment to progress in application development. A reference source with well-understood and highly reproducible characteristics may be an important tool in this context. Researchers around the world should be able to compare the characteristics of their own sources and also their results with this device. In this paper, we describe such a reference source, developed from the simple and robust micro-scaled atmospheric pressure plasma jet ({$\mu$}-APPJ) concept. This development occurred under the auspices of COST Action MP1101 `Biomedical Applications of Atmospheric Pressure Plasmas'. Gas contamination and power measurement are shown to be major causes of irreproducible results in earlier source designs. These problems are resolved in the reference source by refinement of the mechanical and electrical design and by specifying an operating protocol. These measures are shown to be absolutely necessary for reproducible operation. They include the integration of current and voltage probes into the jet. The usual combination of matching unit and power supply is replaced by an integrated LC power coupling circuit and a 5\,W single frequency generator. The design specification and operating protocol for the reference source are being made freely available.},

The diagnostics on-board any spacecraft using electric propulsion will only give punctual values. Therefore, it is important to develop models that permit to forecast the effects of the use of such thrusters in the whole spacecraft.

The PIC technique is used to model the dynamics of both the electrons and ions in the plasma. The grid structure used is constructed using the cylindrical coordinate system. Techniques which permit stable numerical solutions in the cylindrical coordinate system are developed and described. The electromagnetic fields and the plasma dynamics are solved in a self-consistent manner. A compact ECR (electron cyclotron resonance) plasma source used for the generation of ions for materials processing is simulated. This source has a plasma size of 3.6 cm in diameter and 3 cm in height. Simulation results of microwave power absorption, plasma potential, and microwave electric fields are presented. Distributed computing techniques are explored to handle the large computer memory requirements and the long computer simulation times associated with the three-dimensional particle-in-cell plasma model}

It is established that the parameters of secondary electron emission from microparticles can significantly differ from those for metal films and volume targets. Conditions are determined under which negative charging of micron-sized copper particles in electron flow takes place. In the case of spherical microparticles, secondary emission is significantly increased as a result of the oblique incidence of primary electrons. A general approach is proposed that can be used to estimate the electron energy necessary for charging microparticles to high negative potentials.}

The effect of the plasma generating rf power on plasma density was determined by monitoring the optical emission spectrum, ion current collected at dc biased electrode, and the SiO2 etching rate when the substrate was rf biased to -50 V. Also, the low ion energy etching of Si and SiO2 was demonstrated in CF4 and SiF4 plasmas utilizing the dual excitation system. Then, applied to the plasma cleaning of the fluorocarbon layer subsequent to CF4/H2 plasma etching, i.e., a typical gas combination used for SiO2 etching.

The primary emphasis is on plasma-induced emission and laser-induced fluorescence probes of radical and ionic concentrations and temperatures in low pressure discharges like those used in microelectronic fabrication. Other techniques such as optogalvanic, infrared, spontaneous and stimulated Raman, and multiphoton spectroscopy are also discussed briefly. Generally, emission techniques are seen to be useful primarily for qualitative analysis and characterization of the electron energy distribution. However, in some systems, emission actinometry, where an inert gas is used to account for changes in electron density, appears to be a valid means of determining relative changes in concentration. Laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy has only recently been utilized for in situ measurements of ground state ions and radicals but has already yielded insight into mechanisms for formation, destruction, energy transfer, and maintenance of the discharge. By and large the other techniques show great promise but remain to be exploited as diagnostic tools for plasmas.},

  abstract = {A transient spark micro-discharge in nitrogen is investigated between two sharpened electrodes at a pressure of 0.5 bar. The plasma parameters (gas temperature, electron density and reduced electric field) are determined using optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and numerical simulations. The gas temperature of 3500 {$\pm$} 100 K is determined by the comparison of the measured and simulated rotational distributions of the photoemission spectra of neutral molecular nitrogen N2(C-B,0\textendash 0). Both direct and stepwise electron impact excitation are considered in the collision-radiative model. The rate constants for electron impact excitation processes are calculated for different electric field values using the electron velocity distribution function, which is simulated by solving the Boltzmann equation. The applied broadband echelle spectrometer is absolutely calibrated in a spectral range of 200 nm to 800 nm, using two standard light sources, a deuterium lamp and a tungsten ribbon lamp, which are certificated by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany. With the aid of this absolutely calibrated echelle spectrometer and a microwave atmospheric plasma source operated in a nitrogen flow, the intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera, provided with an in-house made optical arrangement for simultaneous two-wavelength diagnostic is calibrated. The spatial resolution of this diagnostic system under the studied plasma conditions amounts to 13 \textmu m. The accurate examination of the experimental results allows determining the dominant process of electron impact excitation of molecular nitrogen ion from ionic ground state. Applying the chosen excitation model of the nitrogen photoemission, the spatially resolved reduced electric field and the electron density are determined. This is done by using the inverse Abel transformation of the absolute intensities of molecular nitrogen bands N2(C-B,0\textendash 0) and (B-X,0\textendash 0), which were measured with the calibrated ICCD camera. The measured electric current of the micro-discharge is compared with the calculated one using the measured plasma parameters and a good coincidence is established.},

A detailed study of these species is important to understand and tune desired effects during the interaction of APPs with solid or liquid materials in industrial or medical applications. In this contribution, the opportunities and challenges of mass spectrometry for detection of neutrals and ions from APPs, fundamental physical phenomena related to the sampling process and their impact on the measured densities of neutrals and fluxes of ions, will be discussed. It is shown that the measurement of stable neutrals and radicals requires a proper experimental design to reduce the beam-to-background ratio, to have little beam distortion during expansion into vacuum and to carefully set the electron energy in the ionizer to avoid radical formation through dissociative ionization. The measured ion composition depends sensitively on the degree of impurities present in the feed gas as well as on the setting of the ion optics used for extraction of ions from the expanding neutral-ion mixture. The determination of the ion energy is presented as a method to show that the analyzed ions are originating from the atmospheric pressure plasma.},

However, absolute densities can usually not be obtained, moreover, the process of sampling of ions and neutrals from such a plasma inherently influences the measured composition. These issues are studied in this contribution by a combination of experimental and numerical methods. Different numerical domains are sequentially coupled to calculate the ion transmission from the source to the mass analyzer. It is found that the energy of the sampled ions created by a radio-frequency microplasma operated in a He-N2 mixture at atmospheric pressure is of the order of 0.1 eV and that it depends linearly on the ion mass in good agreement with the expectation for seeded particles accelerated in a supersonic expansion. Moreover, the measured ion energy distribution from an afterglow of an atmospheric pressure plasma can be reproduced on basis of the particle trajectories in the sampling system. Eventually, an estimation of the absolute flux of ions to the detector is deduced.},

This property makes them interesting objects for fundamental scientific research. Furthermore, there are also the possibilities for applications in the field space propulsion. As there is a lack of fundamental understanding of these plasma phenomena, this article aims to enhance the physical knowledge of fireballs by presenting a mathematical model for the calculation of the force that can be provided by them. It will be shown that all the main plasma parameters such as the plasma potential and the electron density can be derived completely with the knowledge of the potential of the electrode and the radial electron temperature profile. The calculations show very good agreement with the experimental data if two species of electrons (i.e., fast and slow) are considered. Both electron populations have different temperature profiles as is shown with measurements. Furthermore, it will be demonstrated that the potential drop throughout the fireball is much larger than previously thought and that this larger potential drop can considerably contribute to the acceleration of ions in the double layer. This mechanism makes it more likely that the force exerted by the fireball is rather caused by heating of the neutrals via collisions with those accelerated ions and the high energetic ions themselves than by collisions between fast electrons and neutrals.}

Surface phenomena of the satellites (like albedo variations), which might be effects of meteoroid impacts will be compared with the dust environment. Electric charges of particulate matter in the magnetosphere and its consequences will be studied; e.g., the effects of the magnetic field on the trajectories of dust particles and fragmentation of particles due to electrostatic disruption. The investigation is performed with an instrument that measures the mass, speed, flight direction and electric charge of individual dust particles. It is a multicoincidence detector with a mass sensitivity 106 times higher than that of previous in-situ experiments which measured dust in the outer solar system. The instrument weighs 4.2 kg, consumes 2.4 W, and has a normal data transmission rate of 24 bits s-1 in nominal spacecraft tracking mode. On December 29, 1989 the instrument was switched-on. After the instrument had been configured to flight conditions cruise science data collection started immediately. In the period to May 18, 1990 at least 168 dust impacts have been recorded. For 81 of these dust grains masses and impact speeds have been determined. First flux values are given.}

  abstract = {A passive thermal probe has been used to detect dynamic changes in the secondary electron emission (SEE). Oxidized and nitrided materials have been studied during argon ion sputtering in a plasma immersion ion implantation process. Identical measurements have been performed for the metallic state with high voltage pulses accelerating nitrogen ions towards the surface, supposedly forming a nitride layer. Energy flux data were combined with scanning electron microscopy images of the surface to obtain information about the actual surface composition as well as trends and changes during the process. Within the measurements, a direct comparison of the SEE within both employed ion species (argon and nitrogen) is possible while an absolute quantification is still open. Additionally, the nominal composition of the investigated oxide and nitride layers does not always correspond to stoichiometric compounds. Nevertheless, the oxides showed a remarkably higher SEE compared to the pure metals, while an indistinct behavior was observed for the nitrides: some higher, some lower than the clean metal surfaces. For the aluminum alloy AlMg3 a complex time dependent evolution was observed with consecutive oxidation/sputtering cycles leading to a very rough surface with a diminished oxide layer, leading to an almost black surface of the metal and non-reproducible changes in the SEE. The presented method is a versatile technique for measuring dynamic changes of the surface for materials commonly used in PVD processes with a time resolution of about 1 min, e.g. magnetron sputtering or HiPIMS, where changes in the target or electrode composition are occurring but cannot be measured directly.},

A decrease of the duty cycle of the pulsed plasma etch process affects strongly these parameters: the mean ion flux decreases almost by the square of the duty cycle. Furthermore, the contribution of high energy ions from the on-time of the plasma is strongly reduced while their energy is slightly increased. In average, this leads to a significantly reduced ion energy and a reduced ion flux in the pulsed plasma compared to the continuous wave plasma.}

First, the time compensated (TC) silicon etch rate is increased while the SiO2 TC etch rate is decreased at a low duty cycle, whereby the selectivity between silicon and SiO2 etching is strongly increased. Furthermore, the thickness of the sidewall passivation layer is reduced, thereby guiding the etched profile. Finally, the overall homogeneity is increased compared to the continuous wave etching process.}

  abstract = {Multi-dipolar plasmas are sustained in large-volume chambers by a network of antennas located at the wall. Each antenna consists of a permanent magnet, trapping electrons in an axisymmetric dipole field, and a microwave applicator, heating the trapped electrons by cyclotron resonance (ECR). This paper presents a two-dimensional self-consistent model of a plasma sustained by one such antenna. The microwave fields and power absorption are calculated from the Maxwell equations coupled with a local electron momentum equation by an adaptation of the finite difference time domain method. The plasma is described by fluid equations for magnetized electrons and inertial ions, where quasi-neutrality is imposed through a semi-implicit numerical method based on Poisson's equation, which also yields the sheath potentials. Steady-state model results for argon show that below the critical plasma density (7.4 \texttimes{} 1016 m\^-3) the microwave power is absorbed in a narrow region all along the ECR surface around the end of the antenna; beyond this density the main absorption occurs near the plasma edge. Although the electron temperature varies considerably across the magnetic field lines, the plasma potential is nearly uniform all around the antenna and is controlled by the maximum electron temperature.}

  abstract = {Plasma transport across magnetic field lines plays a key role not only in hot fusion plasmas but also in low-temperature plasma sources operating at low pressure, which often rely on external magnetic fields for their operation. Transport in these sources involves different physics than that in fusion plasmas: the ions are not (completely) magnetized, the plasma is sensitive to wall effects because the magnetic field lines intercept the chamber walls, and the neutral gas density is often much larger than the plasma density. This paper gives an overview of the main principles of magnetized low-temperature plasma transport as they are currently understood, including recent insights on the role of magnetic drift. Three important forms of magnetized low-temperature plasma transport are discussed: magnetized plasma diffusion, transport in E \texttimes{} B fields and magnetic drift. These phenomena are illustrated with recent numerical modeling results on a dipolar microwave source, an End-Hall ion source, and simplified version of the ITER negative ion source. For the latter source it is shown that obstructed magnetic drift can lead to plasma asymmetry and increased cross-field transport.}

  abstract = {Fluid models of gas discharges require the input of transport coefficients and rate coefficients that depend on the electron energy distribution function. Such coefficients are usually calculated from collision cross-section data by solving the electron Boltzmann equation (BE). In this paper we present a new user-friendly BE solver developed especially for this purpose, freely available under the name BOLSIG+, which is more general and easier to use than most other BE solvers available. The solver provides steady-state solutions of the BE for electrons in a uniform electric field, using the classical two-term expansion, and is able to account for different growth models, quasi-stationary and oscillating fields, electron-neutral collisions and electron-electron collisions. We show that for the approximations we use, the BE takes the form of a convection-diffusion continuity-equation with a non-local source term in energy space. To solve this equation we use an exponential scheme commonly used for convection-diffusion problems. The calculated electron transport coefficients and rate coefficients are defined so as to ensure maximum consistency with the fluid equations. We discuss how these coefficients are best used in fluid models and illustrate the influence of some essential parameters and approximations.}

  abstract = {Numerical fluid models are widely used in gas discharge physics. A typical discharge model comprises continuity equations and drift\textendash diffusion equations for reactive particle species, a balance equation for the electron energy, and Poisson's equation for the electric field. When this system of equations is integrated numerically with respect to time, the explicit evaluation of coupled quantities necessitates strong time step restrictions, resulting in an enormous slowdown of the calculation. The strongest time step restriction arises from an explicit treatment of the coupling between the charged particle transport and the space charge field. In order to circumvent this constraint several implicit and semi-implicit techniques have been developed. When one uses these techniques, however, the explicit handling of the dependence of electron energy source term on the electron mean energy becomes limiting for the time step. In this work we present a technique for the implicit treatment of the electron energy source term, based on linearization with respect to the electron mean energy. This approach makes it possible to increase the time step by several orders of magnitude, thus giving a tremendous speedup of the calculation. Test results are provided for some typical cases, covering a wide range of numerical conditions.}

We present recent measurements of electron- and photon-stimulated desorption of neutral alkali atoms from LiF and NaCI which attempt to answer these questions by providing details of energy dependence, velocity distributions and variations in the desorption yield as a function of surface temperature. The ground-state neutral desorption dynamics under both electron and photon irradiation are consistent with a model in which halogens are ejected from the surface in a focused collision sequence, while the neutral alkalis are desorbed thermally. However, the excited-state neutrals do not follow this pattern, and further measurements to understand excited-state neutral desorption will be necessary. The implications of the experimental data for an understanding of the desorption mechanism-such as correlations with specific core-level excitations and with mobilities of electronically-induced defects-will be discussed.}

The concentrations of NO are increasing with increasing electric power but decreasing with increasing flow rates. Simultaneously, NO2 concentrations are increasing slightly.

The reference cell provides an experimental platform for comparing plasma measurements carried out in a common reactor geometry by different experimental groups, thereby enhancing the transfer of knowledge and insight gained in rf discharge studies. The results of performing ostensibly identical measurements on six of these cells in five different laboratories are analyzed and discussed. Measurements were made of plasma voltage and current characteristics for discharges in pure argon at specified values of applied voltages, gas pressures, and gas flow rates. Data are presented on relevant electrical quantities derived from Fourier analysis of the voltage and current wave forms. Amplitudes, phase shifts, self-bias voltages, and power dissipation were measured. Each of the cells was characterized in terms of its measured internal reactive components. Comparing results from different cells provides an indication of the degree of precision needed to define the electrical configuration and operating parameters in order to achieve identical performance at various laboratories. The results show, for example, that the external circuit, including the reactive components of the rf power source, can significantly influence the discharge. Results obtained in reference cells with identical rf power sources demonstrate that considerable progress has been made in developing a phenomenological understanding of the conditions needed to obtain reproducible discharge conditions in independent reference cells.}

The conditions for the formation of a stable plasma-sheath boundary are briefly examined and a general criterion is obtained without considering any specific mechanism of ion transport. No assumptions are made regarding the energy distribution of the ions, and the result is therefore a refinement on Bohm's original criterion which was derived by assuming a monoenergetic ion flux. With the aid of the criterion developed in the present treatment conclusions are then drawn in the case of the collision-free model regarding conditions applying at the plasma boundary. The experimental results are found to be consistent with these theoretical conditions.},

The state of all particles not in thermal equilibrium with the lattice can be described by a gas-like model in which the atoms move with constant mean free path. Collisions are assumed to occur only with "fixed" lattice atoms, but binding energies are neglected. The distribution functions exhibit finite discontinuities in the energy which approximate the behavior of the correct functions. The sputtering ratio is determined by integration over the velocity direction and also over energy, thus averaging out the approximation. The resulting expression for the sputtering ratio depends upon four atomic parameters of the system. In principle all are measurable, but only the mass ratio is known with precision at the present time. The theoretical curve is fitted to the experimental data which are available for eight ion-metal combinations. The curve is found to be very sensitive to the choice of fitting parameters, and the parameters exhibit considerable internal consistency. The theory indicates certain areas of experimental research which should add to present understanding of the process.}

Low-order spherical harmonics and Fourier series are used to describe the major variations throughout the atmosphere including latitude, annual, semiannual, and simplified local time and longitude variations. While month to month details cannot be completely represented, lower atmosphere temperature data are fit to an overall standard deviation of 3 K and pressure to 2\%.

Soc. 129, 2764 (1982)] is a novel technique which promises to have wide application in the semiconductor industry for the removal of silicon and polymeric materials. Its advantages include relatively high concentrations of both ions and chemically excited species and the ability to etch isotropically. This allows high etch rates to be achieved with a minimum of ion bombardment. Langmuir probe studies have been performed on microwave (915 MHz) plasmas in O2 to determine the spatial variation of the plasma parameters (ion density, electron temperature, and space potential), as well as their dependence on gas pressure, microwave power, and the addition of CF4. Probes have also been used in microwave plasmas with an rf bias applied to an internal electrode (combination plasmas). Ion densities on the order of 2 x 10\^10 cm\^-3 were typical in the spatial afterglow of microwave plasmas with an O2 pressure of 100 mTorr, and values as high as 7\texttimes 1010 cm\^-3 were observed at lower pressures. Average electron temperatures between 1 and 2 eV were prevalent in the microwave plasmas while rf biasing the substrate electrode leads to a value of 7 eV near the etching surface.}

For this purpose, the wall-bound surplus charge arising from the plasma is modeled as a quasistationary electron surface layer in thermal equilibrium with the wall. It satisfies Poisson's equation and minimizes the grand canonical potential of wall-thermalized excess electrons. Based on an effective model for a graded interface taking into account the image potential and the offset of the conduction band to the potential just outside the dielectric, we specifically calculate the modification of the potential and the distribution of the surplus electrons for MgO, SiO2, and Al2O3 surfaces in contact with a helium discharge. Depending on the electron affinity of the surface, we find two vastly different behaviors. For negative electron affinity, electrons do not penetrate into the wall and a quasi-two-dimensional electron gas is formed in the image potential, while, for positive electron affinity, electrons penetrate into the wall and a negative space-charge layer develops in the interior of the dielectric. We also investigate how the non-neutral electron surface layer\textendash which can be understood as the ultimate boundary of a bounded gas discharge\textendash merges with the neutral bulk of the dielectric.}

Varying the potential of this probe disclosed that some electrons ejected from the probe surface and hence from all cathode walls penetrate into the dark space opposite to the surface of their origin. These electrons can reach the opposite wall if the pressure and the cathode diameter are too low, in which case they will be removed. This removal causes the hollow cathode discharge to extinguish at higher pressures than is the case for linear discharges. Electrons that cross the cathode cavity entirely can pass through a small hole in the cathode wall into a high vacuum chamber and be analysed energetically. The same experiment also discloses the energy distribution of electrons leaving the cathode surface. A comparison with the theory recently published 3 shows that pendelelectrons can be responsible for the currrent amplification observed in the hollow cathode discharge.}

Due to the scattering geometry only the energy distribution perpendicular to the magnetic field could be measured. Our results show that in low-density plasmas the eedf significantly deviates from Maxwellian for electron energies larger than approximately 20 eV.

  abstract = {The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of silicon carbide (Sic) from tetramethylsilane Si(CHJ4 (TMS) on a graphite susceptor at 1200-1500 K is studied in a low pressure (=lo0 Pa) cold-wall reactor under laminar flow conditions. In addition to material characterizations (electron microscopy and chemical analysis), the gas-phase temperature distribution and composition are investigated by combining several in situ and ex situ diagnostics. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) on TMS and H2 (produced from TMS decomposition) in the hot zone of the reactor gives the rotational temperature distribution of the molecules and their concentrations. Within a few mean free paths from the surface, the H2 gas temperature is lower than the surface temperature. This is due to a nonunity accommodation coefficient a of H2 on Sic. A simple analytical model yields a = 0.05 for H2 on Sic. Using gas transport coefficients and the experimental value of a for H2, a twdhensional numerical code is used to compute the gas flow and temperature profiles in the reactor. The increase of the H2 concentration and the decrease of TMS concentration close to the surface reveals that gas-phase pyrolysis of TMS occurs within a fewmillimeters from the hot surface. The gas composition at the outlet of the reactor is analyzed by mass spectrometry and IR absorption spectroscopy. The global gas conversion and material balance between deposited SIC, powders, and exhaust gases is obtained. Si atoms of TMS molecules are mostly converted into solid Sic and powders. In the gaseous products a small fraction of trimethylsilane SiH(CH3)3 is detected. Other gases in decreasing order of importance are H? CH,, C2H4, and C2H2. These results are compared with predictions of some thermodynamic models and chemical mechanisms reported in the literature.}

In order to understand the gas-phase temperature distribution in front of a hot surface, thermal exchanges are studied on different gas/surface systems: H2/SiC, H2/C, H2/W, or N2/W. We observe a gap between the temperature of the hot surface and that of the nearby gas. This temperature gap is predicted using an accommodation coefficient which ranges from 0.15 for H2 on a graphite surface to 0.05 on a SiC surface. The measurements show a quite different behavior with H2 and N2. With the latter, a non-Boltzmann rotational population distribution is observed at a distance of one mean free path from the surface. Physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms are invoked to explain the results.},

From moving structures, we progress to stable ones: sheaths and double layers. How can we measure double-layer potentials? This question leads to the development of emissive probe techniques. From there, we move on to the Bohm criterion and the first measurements of the full plasma potential variations of sheaths and presheaths in a single-species plasma, and later in two-ion-species plasmas. Finally, our recent measurements of double layers and presheaths in uniform helicon plasma are presented.}

The presented thrust balance has a resolution of 0.1 \textmu N in a bandwidth between 1 and 10Hz. As a general measurement principle, we chose a pendulum balance. The setup consists of two pendulums to enable a common mode rejection. To suppress the eigenfrequency of the pendulums, a damping system based on an eddy current brake is part of the balance assembly. A heterodyne laser interferometer is used as the translation sensor. Different measurements were performed to investigate the noise performance of the pendulum. The results are presented and analyzed. The measurement system was used to measure the thrust of a micro-high efficiency multistage plasma thruster.},

The discharge operated in a regime where two subsequent microdischarges appeared within the same voltage half-period. The electrical analysis of the barrier discharge setup enabled us to quantify charge transfer and the effective electric field development. During the second microdischarge the positive surface streamers follow the interface (triple-line) between the area of deposited charge from the previous one and the area of uncharged dielectric surface. It is shown that additional branching and flashes of surface streamers are responsible for the increased spatial complexity of the deposited surface charges at high overvoltage. A suppressed streamer propagating over the area of deposited surface charge was tracked and the evidence of surface streamer reconnection is presented. A spatiotemporal distribution (resolution of 120 ps and 100 {$\mu$}m) of the reduced electric field strength was obtained for both microdischarges from the recorded luminosities of the molecular nitrogen. The reduced electric field of positive streamers in the first microdischarge reached 1200 Td. For the second one, the electric field values for the streamer at the triple-line are slightly lower than that, while for the suppressed streamers are even higher.},

  abstract = {An effective single-band Hamiltonian representing a crystal electron in a uniform magnetic field is constructed from the tight-binding form of a Bloch band by replacing \$\textbackslash hbar \textbackslash veck\$ by the operator \$\textbackslash vecp-e\textbackslash vecA/c\$. The resultant Schr\"odinger equation becomes a finite-difference equation whose eigenvalues can be computed by a matrix method. The magnetic flux which passes through a lattice cell, divided by a flux quantum, yields a dimensionless parameter whose rationality or irrationality highly influences the nature of the computed spectrum. The graph of the spectrum over a wide range of "rational" fields is plotted. A recursive structure is discovered in the graph, which enables a number of theorems to be proven, bearing particularly on the question of continuity. The recursive structure is not unlike that predicted by Azbel', using a continued fraction for the dimensionless parameter. An iterative algorithm for deriving the clustering pattern of the magnetic subbands is given, which follows from the recursive structure. From this algorithm, the nature of the spectrum at an "irrational" field can be deduced; it is seen to be an uncountable but measure-zero set of points (a Cantor set). Despite these-features, it is shown that the graph is continuous as the magnetic field varies. It is also shown how a spectrum with simplified properties can be derived from the rigorously derived spectrum, by introducing a spread in the field values. This spectrum satisfies all the intuitively desirable properties of a spectrum. The spectrum here presented is shown to agree with that predicted by A. Rauh in a completely different model for crystal electrons in a magnetic field. A new type of magnetic "superlattice" is introduced, constructed so that its unit cell intercepts precisely one quantum of flux. It is shown that this cell represents the periodicity of solutions of the difference equation. It is also shown how this superlattice allows the determination of the wave function at nonlattice sites. Evidence is offered that the wave functions belonging to irrational fields are everywhere defined and are continuous in this model, whereas those belonging to rational fields are only defined on a discrete set of points. A method for investigating these predictions experimentally is sketched.}

Post-oxidation of hydrogenated silicon particles trapped in an argon plasma was obtained by adding oxygen.

The plasma density in argon is 93109 cm23 (620 \%) at an applied rf voltage of 250 V (500 V peak to peak) and a gas pressure of 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr). The electron density scales linearly with applied voltage. The plasma to ground sheath resistance is shown to be very important with a value of 810 V in argon at a pressure of 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr) and discharge current of 0.1 A. The value of plasma to ground resistance scales inversely with discharge current and sublinear with pressure. Two standard features in the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) have been proposed as a test of the ability of a probe system to resolve features, first, the transition from a low temperature ({$<$}1 eV) bi-Maxwellian distribution to a Druyveysten distribution (3 eV) at 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr) in argon, and the "hole" in the EEDF at 2 eV to 4 eV in nitrogen plasmas.}

This paper shows that high SiO2etch selectivity is most easily obtained at low pressure in the CF4/H2 process. The etched angle is controlled by metal film deposition which can be independent of the etch selectivity. A combined (metal+polymer) deposition and SiO2etch process has been tested on commercial complementary metal-oxide semiconductor wafers with excellent yield and reliability results. This multiple deposition and etch process is best done in a new trielectrode hollow cathode chamber which exhibits 1 {$\mu$}m/min SiO2etch rate with better than {$\pm$}1\% etch uniformity, an etched angle of 75\textdegree, and SiO2/Si selectivities of 50 (wafer edge) and 150 (wafer center). In addition, polymer deposition on surfaces near the wafer has been eliminated. The voltage and pressure dependence of Si deposition from SiH4 is described, and the hollow cathode ion bombardment is shown to give best planarization at low pressures (2 Pa) and low deposition rates (0.2 {$\mu$}m/min). A planarized SiO\_2 film is also shown.}

In argon at intermediate pressure, i.e. tens of mbar, the electron temperature decays very fast after power off and approaches the heavy particle temperature, while the electron density decays slower, in the order of tens of microseconds. Argon with small admixtures of O{$_2$} or H{$_2$} exhibits a similar behavior. However, strikingly different is the result for small additions of N{$_2$} or CO{$_2$}. For up to 100?{$\mu$}s after the power is switched off, the electron temperature does not decrease to the gas temperature but remains at values as high as 0.8?eV. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide exhibit relatively large cross-sections to excite vibrational states by electron collisions. Knowing that, the observed post-heating can be attributed to super-elastic energy transfer from vibrational excited N{$_2$}(X) and CO{$_2$}(X) molecules to electrons.},

The measured spectra consist of a thermal and a high-energy contribution, the relative intensities of which strongly depend on the mass of the bombarding ions. The sputter mechanism can be explained by formation of so-called excitons in the bulk and by the random collision cascade theory. Furthermore, selective sputtering of I in the case of Kr+ and Xe+ bombardment must be taken into account. The use of the DSLS yields a good signal-to-noise ratio even for particle densities less than 100 particles/cm3 within a velocity interval \textbackslash Delta v=50 m/sec.

This unexpected reversal of the asymmetry reinforces the need for these fully self-consistent calculations, but renders the use of the flux ratio for Mach-probe purposes problematic, even for deriving the direction of the flow.}

But the charge, even on conducting spheres and at zero flow, is not well represented by using the standard expression for capacitance. Insulating spheres become asymmetrically charged because of ion collection asymmetry, and their total (negative) charge is considerably increased by flow. The collection flux asymmetry is documented for both conducting and insulating spheres and is not greatly different between them. The drag force upon the sphere is obtained from the code calculations. It shows reasonable agreement with appropriate analytic approximations. However, numerical discrepancies up to 20\% are found, which are attributed to uncertainties in the analytical values.}

The theoretical instability criterion derived is that the Debye length should exceed approximately the probe radius divided by the Mach number, when the ion flux asymmetry has its intuitive direction and size. The saturated state is then that the particle rotates at a fraction of the ion plasma frequency. However, for the conditions of many experiments, intuition is incorrect, and the direction of charge asymmetry is such as to yield stability.}

It is found that for dust separations larger than the shielding length the dust parameters for the two dust particles match with the single particle values. As the dust separation is equal to or less than the shielding length, the transverse component of ion force increases which is due to dynamic shielding effect caused by neighboring dust particle. However, dust charge, potential, and ion drag are found not to be affected considerably. Further, dust charge and potential on an arrangement of nine dust particles are computed. The dust charge and potential do not differ much from the single particle values for the presheath. However the dust charges of multiple dust particles in the sheath are much less negative compared to the single dust case which is shown to be due to ion focusing.}

This assumption is not made in the present paper. Results for the spatial variation of average energy are close to those obtained from exact solution to the linearized Boltzmann equation. In addition, it is shown that diffusion theory with energy balance gives a relation between characteristic energy and drift-tube geometry which is in close agreement with the empirical relation that has been used for years to analyze steady drift-tube measurements, without invoking the assumption of anisotropic diffusion.}

It is shown that the momentum-transfer equation can be integrated when \textbackslash nu c(C), the frequency of elastic collisions between electrons and gas atoms, is independent of the electron speed c, and the hydrostatic-pressure term is neglected. The resulting current-voltage (J-V) curve, which is valid for all gas pressures, reduces to the proper vacuum law (J V3/2) at extremely low gas pressure and to the proper high-pressure law (J V2) at high gas pressure, while it is a mixture of the two laws for intermediate gas pressures. The importance of the ratio \textbackslash nu c / \textbackslash nu p, where \textbackslash nu c is the average value of \textbackslash nu c(C) and \textbackslash nu p is the electron-plasma frequency, is emphasized. It is shown that the current is inertia limited for \textbackslash nu c / \textbackslash nu p {$<$} 1, and is mobility limited for \textbackslash nu c / \textbackslash nu p {$>$} 1. It is shown further that mobility-limited flow divides naturally into two cases, according to whether the electrons retain the energy imparted to them by the electric field or whether this energy is given up in elastic collisions with atoms. The former situation, called the low-pressure case, prevails when (m/M) 1/2 \textbackslash nu c / \textbackslash nu p {$<$} 1, and the latter, called the high-pressure case, prevails when (m/M) 1/2 \textbackslash nu c / \textbackslash nu p {$>$} 1, where m / M is the ratio of electron mass to atom mass.}

After switching off the rf power, in the afterglow plasma, ions and electrons rapidly recombine and leave a cloud of charged microparticles. Because of microgravity, the particles remain suspended in the experimental chamber for a sufficiently long time, allowing precise measurements of the rest particle charge. A simple theoretical model for the decharging is proposed which agrees quite well with the experiment results and predicts the rest charge at lower gas pressures.}

  abstract = {The science and technology of electric propulsion (EP) encompass a broad variety of strategies for achieving very high exhaust velocities, in order to reduce the total propellant burden and corresponding launch mass of present and future space transportation systems. These techniques group broadly into three categories: electrothermal propulsion, wherein the propellant is electrically heated, then expanded thermodynamically through a nozzle; electrostatic propulsion, wherein ionized propellant particles are accelerated through an electric field; and electromagnetic propulsion, wherein current driven through a propellant plasma interacts with an internal or external magnetic field to provide streamwise body force. Such systems can produce an order of magnitude higher range of exhaust velocities and payload mass fractions than the the most advanced chemical rockets, thereby enabling or substantially enhancing many attractive space missions. Their attainable thrust densities (thrust per unit exhaust area) are much lower, however, predicating longer flight times and more complex mission trajectories. In addition, they require space-borne electric power supplies of low specific mass and high reliability, interfaced with suitable power processing equipment. Optimization of EP systems thus involves multidimensional tradeoffs among mission objectives, propellant and power plant mass, trip time, internal and external environmental factors, and overall system reliability. An enduring international program of research and development of viable electric thrusters has been in progress for several decades, and over the past few years has lead to the increasing use of a number of EP systems on commercial and governmental spacecraft. Meanwhile, yet more advanced EP concepts have matured to high credibility for future mission applications.},

Energetic argon neutrals are detected by sampling neutrals through a 100 ?m orifice in the cathode. Downstream the orifice neutrals are analyzed parallel to the cathode normal with a quadrupolemass spectrometer equipped with an energy filter having an angular acceptance of about 2.5\textdegree. The pressure range considered was between 5 and 50 mTorr with dc bias potentials between \$-100\$ and \$-400\$ V. The measured neutral energy distributions for low pressures and low dc bias potentials have a maximum intensity at low energies slowly decreasing toward higher energies. For higher pressures and higher dc bias potentials the energy distributions have minimal intensities at low energies, exhibit a maximum at roughly 40 eV, subsequently decreasing toward higher energies. This behavior is explained as being caused by multiple scattering of energetic neutrals in the sheath. Experimental neutral energy distributions are compared with Monte Carlo simulations. In the calculations charge exchangecollisions, elastic scattering, and multiple collisions are taken into account. Experimental and theoretical neutral energy distributions are in fairly good agreement clearly indicating that multiple scattering of neutrals in the sheath is an important mechanism determining their energy distributions.},

We present a detailed comparison of a modelling and experimental study with a goal to elucidate the plasma chemistry in a humid Ar radiofrequency-driven atmospheric pressure plasma jet. A large group of species including radicals (H, OH, O, HO2) and long-lived species (H2, O2 and H2O2) in the jet effluent was experimentally quantified by molecular beam mass spectroscopy (MBMS). MBMS measurements of H2O2, OH and H were validated by direct comparison with a liquid phase colorimetric measurement, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and two-photon absorption LIF respectively. While an excellent agreement was found for OH and H2O2 by both techniques, a significant difference was found for H and shown to be due to boundary layer effects at the MBMS sampling substrate. The measured O, OH, HO2 and H2 are in good agreement with the plug model while H and O2 were underestimated and H2O2 was overestimated by the model. The accuracy of both the used reaction set and the diagnostics, as well as the observed discrepancies between the modeling and experimental results, are critically assessed. The results presented in this work enable us to identify further data needs for describing H2O vapor chemistry in low-temperature plasmas.},

In this work, the mechanisms enabling the conversion of methane to CO, CO2 and methanol enabled by plasma-enhanced catalysis were investigated. A catalyst reactor was incorporated downstream of the plasma jet to enable the separation between plasma generation and the catalyst bed. An enhancement in CH3OH and CO2 production was observed for the shortest distance between the plasma and catalyst compared to the plasma-only case. Plasma-enabled gas heating was shown not to be responsible for the observed synergy while a gas temperature increase as low as 30\textendash 40~K significantly impacted desorption rates of CH3OH/C2H5OH on alumina particles. Correlations between molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) measurements at the inlet and outlet of the catalytic reactor suggest that the observed synergistic effect was caused by radical species most likely the CH3O2 radical. This study shows that surface reactions induced by radicals such as alkylperoxy radicals might play an important role in surface reactions in plasma-catalysis.},

The spatio-temporal distributions of the ionization rate and the power deposition within the hollow cathode imply that sheath oscillation heating is the primary mechanism to sustain the RF HCD, whereas secondary electron emission plays a negligible role.

The conditions are chosen such that both plasmas are ionizing. It is found that a helium plasma has a higher electron temperature and a lower electron density than an equi-operational argon plasma, i.e. an argon plasma that is operated at the same external conditions. This is mainly caused by the higher excitation potential of the first excited state and the lower mass of helium, respectively. Due to these differences in electron density and temperature the densities of the helium ground state and of the excited states are much larger than their corresponding Saha equilibrium values for a wide range of conditions. The consequence of this is that the spectroscopic methods, which are used to determine the electron density and temperature, have a very limited validity region in the case of helium. For argon the deviations are much smaller so that these methods can often be applied safely.},

The hydrogen plasma is produced by hot cathode filament discharge method in a dusty plasma device. A full line cusped magnetic field cage is used to confine the plasma elements. To study the plasma parameters for various discharge conditions, a cylindrical Langmuir probe having 0.15 mm diameter and 10.0 mm length is used. An electronically controlled dust dropper is used to drop the dust particles into the plasma. For different discharge conditions, the dust current is measured using a Faraday cup connected to an electrometer.

  abstract = {The properties of sputtered and scattered ions are studied for ion beam sputtering of Si by bombardment with noble gas ions. The energy distributions in dependence on ion beam parameters (ion energy: 0.5\textendash 1 keV; ion species: Ne, Ar, Xe) and geometrical parameters (ion incidence angle, polar emission angle, and scattering angle) are measured by means of energy-selective mass spectrometry. The presence of anisotropic effects due to direct sputtering and scattering is discussed and correlated with process parameters. The experimental results are compared to calculations based on a simple elastic binary collision model and to simulations using the Monte-Carlo code sdtrimsp. The influence of the contribution of implanted primary ions on energy distributions of sputtered and scattered particles is studied in simulations. It is found that a 10\% variation of the target composition leads to detectable but small differences in the energy distributions of scattered ions. Comparison with previously reported data for other ion/target configurations confirms the presence of similar trends and anisotropic effects: the number of high-energy sputtered ions increases with increasing energy of incident ions and decreasing scattering angle. The effect of the ion/target mass ratio is additionally investigated. Small differences are observed with the change of the primary ion species: the closer the mass ratio to unity, the higher the average energy of sputtered ions. The presence of peaks, assigned to different mechanisms of direct scattering, strongly depends on the ion/target mass ratio.}

In the category of problems that are primarily the responsibility of ion-source manufacturers: the need for excessive maintenance has an obvious and direct impact on cost; the lack of reproducibility of both ion-beam profile and direction results in an overall lack of reliability that has required an excessive degree of care by highly skilled operators; and the lack of adequate information from the manufacturer is a problem that, in turn, aggravates all other problems. From examination of ion sources and industrial applications of these sources, most ion sources are misused, as well as being unsuited for production applications. There is an obvious need for improved education of ion-source operators and improved ion-source design.}

The dissociation fraction in SF6/Ar (95/5\%) plasma at 20 mTorr was over a factor of 22 lower than SF6/O2/Ar (85/10/5\%) plasma. For a fixed gas pressure and power of 60 mTorr and 500 W the F+ signal showed a variation of up to a factor of 60 depending if O2 was in the feedstock gas which indicates a marked enhancement of [F] with O2 addition. Fluorine actinometry was also used to monitor relative fluorine atom concentrations. A comparison of actinometry with APMS showed that a classical actinometric approach for measuring fluorine atoms was unreliable for the conditions examined in this work. Over the power range investigated the absolute fluorine concentration increased by a factor of 10 whereas the actinometric signal only showed a two fold increase.},

Closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputtering (CFUBMS) is an exceptionally versatile technique for the deposition of high-quality, well-adhered films. The development, fundamental principles and applications of the CFUBMS process are, therefore, discussed in some detail in this review.

  abstract = {The feedback between particles and the heating of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) from argon is investigated. The ICP is heated by a pancake coil antenna, which is coupled to the plasma via a dielectric window. Particles are generated by injecting a pulse of acetylene for a few seconds into an argon plasma. Afterwards, the emission of the ICP starts to oscillate with a frequency of the order of several tens of hertz. This effect differs from an attachment instability, because the oscillation persists in the argon plasma even though argon is not an electronegative gas. It is proposed that the oscillation is linked to a periodic change of particle location in the discharge volume: if particles are close to the dielectric window, the local electron density is reduced and the inductive heating is inefficient; if the particles are located at the centre of the plasma, the electron density in front of the dielectric window can build up and the inductive heating is efficient. This is an unstable situation, because when the inductive heating is efficient the ion drag force expels particles from the centre and confines them again in front of the dielectric window. This reduces the efficiency of the inductive heating. An oscillation between two states results: (i) particles in front of the dielectric window and an inefficient inductive heating; (ii) particles at the centre of the discharge and an efficient inductive heating. The feasibility of this oscillation as a tool to monitor and to control particle sizes and densities is discussed.}

The results show that the geometry of the nozzle head has a significant impact on the resulting energy flux. The relaxation volume affects the dependence of the energy flux on the gas flow. While there is no significant influence of the working gas flow on the energy flux without a relaxation volume, utilizing a relaxation volume leads to a decrease of the energy flux with increasing working gas flow. Within the analyzed parameter range, the energy flux reveals for both nozzle heads a linear dependency on the applied primary voltage.},

With the appropriate boundary conditions and constraints on the interpolation kernel, it can be shown that the order of accuracy of the cubic convolution method is between that of linear interpolation and that of cubic splines. A one-dimensional interpolation function is derived in this paper. A separable extension of this algorithm to two dimensions is applied to image data.}

It is shown that for a pointlike particle the binary collision approach yields correct results provided that the effective plasma screening length is chosen appropriately. The correct choice follows from the self-consistent kinetic theory. On the other hand, the binary collision approach accounts consistently for the effects of finite grain size and grain charging. Taking these effects into account an expression for the ion drag force is obtained. Calculations are performed for a typical (exemplary) set of complex plasma parameters. The relevance for recent complex plasma experiments is briefly discussed.}

Analysis shows that the ion drag usually exceeds the electrostatic force in the limit of weak electric field. We suggest that this is the cause of the central ''void" observed in microgravity complex plasma experiments.}

And a lot of research and developmental works in the field of SPT were realized since that event. The main steps of these works are considered in the paper. As a result, over 140 SPTs operated or operate in space for spacecraft orbit correction and, in particular, for the geostationary satellite final positioning and their stationkeeping. Nowadays, the SPT technology becomes the worldwide, namely: some developments of own SPT versions are realized in France and USA, SPT implementation on board Western satellites was started. Developments of new SPTs are naturally continued in Russia. And some of their latest results are represented in the paper, as well as the main results of R\&D works on other EP types.

  abstract = {Low pressure ({$<$}50 mTorr) electron cyclotron resonance plasma sources are being developed for downstream etching and deposition and for production of radicals for surface treatment. The spatial coupling of microwave radiation to the plasma is a concern due to issues related to the uniformity of dissociation, electron heating, and ultimately process uniformity. To investigate these issues, a finite-difference-time-domain simulation for microwave injection and propagation has been developed, and has been incorporated as a module in the two-dimensional Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model. Results from parametric studies of N2 plasmas suggest that obtaining uniform fluxes to the substrate may require a power deposition profile that is peaked off axis. An increase in power deposition tends to reinforce nonuniformities in the ion flux profile. At higher pressures ({$>$}10 mTorr) the sensitivity of the ion flux to the substrate to the angle of the magnetic field at the substrate decreases, while the uniformity of the ion flux improves. Due to the dependence of the collision frequency on electron temperature, losses from cross-field diffusion are enhanced in both the low and high pressure regimes. Results also suggest that there is an optimal pressure for maximizing both the magnitude of the ion flux to the substrate surface and its uniformity.}

  abstract = {A High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) system was used for deposition of hematite thin films. Ion flux density on substrate was studied for different pulse discharge current densities corresponding to different pulsing frequencies of cathode voltage. Total thermal power flux density on substrate was investigated for the same plasma conditions as ion flux density was measured. Our findings revealed the pulse ion flux density on substrate linearly increases with pulse discharge current density whilst the total thermal power density decreases on about 50\% when discharge pulsing frequency falls from 50 kHz to 100 Hz. Our previous investigation proved that the change in the discharge pulsing frequency has significant influence on microstructure of deposited hematite thin film. Results of our study imply that magnitude of the ion flux density on substrate leads to highly textured hematite thin film oriented along the desired (110) plane. Nevertheless the ion flux density on substrate is not substantial contribution to the total energy balance on substrate. Other elementary processes taking place on substrate probably can play a significant role in hematite thin film formation. The highest photocurrents of 0.86 mA cm\`A2 at 0.55 V and 0.99 mA cm\`A2 at 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl was revealed for the HiPIMS deposited films having the thickness of 25 nm and after the thermal treatment at 750  C for 30 min. The photocurrents of 0.7 mA cm\`A2 at 0.55 V and 0.82 mA cm\`A2 at 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl of hematite films annealed at 650  C for 30 min were reached when the voltage bias was applied to the FTO substrate during the deposition.},

  abstract = {Normal and Tangential Momentum Accommodation for Earth Satellite Conditions. Momentum accommodation was determined experimentally for gas-surface interactions simulating in a practical way those of near-earth satellites. Throughout the ranges of gas energies and incidence angles of interest for earthconditions, two components of force were measured by means of a vacuum microbalance to determine the normal and tangential momentum-accommodation coefficients for nitrogen ions on technical-quality aluminum surfaces. For these experimental conditions, the electrodynamics of ion neutralization near the surface indicate that results for nitrogen ions should differ relatively little from those for nitrogen molecules, which comprise the largest component of momentum flux for near-earth satellites. The experimental results indicated that both normal and tangential momentum-accommodation coefficients varied widely with energy, tending to be relatively well accommodated at the higher energies, but becoming progressively less accommodated as the energy was reduced to and below that for earth-satellite speeds. Both coefficients also varied greatly with incidence angle, the normal momentum becoming less accommodated as the incidence angle became more glancing, whereas the tangential momentum generally became more fully accommodated. For each momentum coefficient, an empirical correlation function was obtained which closely approximated the experimental results over the ranges of energy and incidence angle. Most of the observed variations of momentum accommodation with energy and incidence angle were qualitatively indicated by a calculation using a three-dimensional model that simulated the target surface by a one-dimensional attractive potential and hard sphere reflectors.},

  abstract = {An apparatus is described for the extraction of ions from flames burning at atmospheric pres\-sure, and for the subsequent mass analysis of the ions. It consists essentially of a fine leak in a platinum or quartz diaphragm on which the flame is played, and on the other side of which a low pressure is maintained by pumping. The ions are separated by suitable disposition of electrodes in a series of expansion chambers before passing into the analyzer. It is concluded that secondary ionization is not important in the mass spectrometer, and that charge exchange reactions and other related types of reaction, in so far as they occur inside the spectrometer, largely reflect similar reactions occurring in the external flame. Ionic concentrations as low as 10               5               per cm               3               can be measured for ions ranging in mass from 10 to 400 atomic units. A brief account is given of the ionization observed from premixed flames of hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. The most evident positive ion was hydroxonium (H               3               O               +               ), the other important ones being NH               +               4               and NO               +               . The first two of these also occurred in hydrated forms, associated with up to 4 molecules of water. These hydrates occur to a large extent in the cooler parts of the flame system (just before the reaction zone), and are considered to be a secondary phenomenon, possibly formed by association just inside the entry leak into the spectrometer. Experimental evidence is adduced for the formation of H               3               O               +               in the homogeneous gas phase in and near the reaction zone, rather than by catalytic interaction with the walls of the leak. The most likely reaction is considered to be H + H + OH = H               3               O               +               +               e               -               and the kinetics of this are considered. Doubts about the heat of formation of this ion, and about that of the NH               +               4               ion preclude quantitative decisions on many points. The ionization of nitric oxide is shown to be essentially a thermal phenomenon, by observations of ionization with known amounts of nitric oxide added to the flame gases. The relatively slow rate of recombination observed beyond the reaction zone is discussed, and found to be in line with previous results.},

Hence the origins and handling of such distortions are reviewed here. In the main body of this review, radical recombination and heat transfer at the external probe surface, acceleration into the probe orifice, chemical relaxation in the free jet, radial diffusion in the free jet, skimmer interference, Mach-number focusing, and fragmentation during detection are considered. A section on miscellaneous possible origins of distortions reviews briefly condensation, preferential scattering of beam molecules by background molecules, background invasion of the free jet, overun of slower molecules by faster molecules when sampling from an unsteady source, and contaminating the time-averaged signal for a given sampling location by the stored time-averaged signal for the prior sampling location. It is concluded that the increased understanding of MBMS sampling has provided the means for either avoiding or handling the possible distortions sufficiently so that MBMS sampling has graduated from an object of research and development to a tool for studies of complicated combustion systems.},

The mechanical noise induced from the background vibrations becomes a crucial problem for precise estimate of thrust particularly in low impulse measurements. A data analysis method to reduce the effect of mechanical noise is proposed by introducing an additional term in a fitting function. It was verified that the analysis method used in our experimental conditions reduced variance caused by noise down to one-third that of a normal fitting method. The accuracy of the thrust stand is 2.1 {$\mu$}Ns in the case of the LP-PPT and 0.7 {$\mu$}Ns in the case of the diode laser microthruster.},

Deposition by using a hollow-cathode discharge (HCD) gun, however, is one of the potential solutions; HCD generates very high density plasma between the substrate and the evaporation source. The plasma also serves to produce compound chemical films when reactive gas is properly introduced during deposition. Ductile Cr films are obtained in a variety of substrate temperatures ranging from 20\textdegree{} to 670?\textdegree C and an applied negative voltage from 0 to -200 V to the substrate. Hardness, corrosion resistance, and surface roughness are closely related to the experimental parameters. Hard carbide and nitride are formed by introducing acetylene and nitrogen, respectively, to a partial pressure around 1 \textbackslash times 10-4 Torr (1.33 \textbackslash times 10-2 Pa) mixed in argon of 7.5 \textbackslash times 10-4 Torr (0.1 Pa); hollow-cathode discharge with or without a negative bias voltage gives a sound film at a relatively low substrate temperature of 350?\textdegree C or higher. These films have high micro Vickers hardness between 1100 to 1800 and 1200 to 1600 for carbide and nitride, respectively. The carbide and the nitride films show reasonably good corrosion resistance and good adhesion to steel substrates.}

It is shown that the theory based on the relaxation of the nonequilibrium electron-ion system gives a common basis for the electronic stopping power of slow ions due to valence electrons and for the energy transfer via an electron-phonon interaction. It is found that the energy loss owing to the electron-phonon interaction bears a close relationship to the electronic stopping power, but it is greatly enhanced because of the emergence of phonon excitations and band structure. The corresponding cooling rates of the thermalizing cascade are several times greater in metals with a strong electron-ion interaction than in metals with a weak interaction. A similar conclusion holds in the intermediate region, where the ions in the thermalizing cascade are essentially free to move but band-structure effects persist. However, conduction electrons play a role in the cooling of the cascade only if the dynamics of the ions gives rise to phonons.}

  abstract = {The paper reports the first test results of a new High Efficient Multistage Plasma thruster (HEMP thruster) concept, unique by its potential for extremely low wall losses and low sputter erosion, its high thrust densities and extremely wide operational ranges. The highest thrust and thrust density (thrust per channel exit area) of 43 mN and 16.9 mN/cm{$^2$} were measured so far with demonstrator model DM3a MS2 on the thrust balance of ONERA in July 02 at 30 sccm Xe flow, 500 V and 2.88 A, respectively. This operational limit was not set by the device, but the limited test time and power supply capabilities. At the same test campaign another demonstrator model DM3a MS1-2 having a slightly lower apparent ion beam angle and delivering a thrust of 24 mN provided within the smaller operational stability range the best combination of total efficiency and specific impulse with 31\% and 1682 s, respectively, at a Xe flow of 15 sccm, an anode voltage of 550 V and an anode current of 1.16 A. For brevity, the details are not given here. A further improved version, DM3a MS1-3, was tested in Oct. 02 at IOM at Leipzig with respect to angular and energy distribution of the ion beam at one selected operating point of 8 sccm, 500 V and 0.505 A. The performed measurements provided insight into the distribution of the multistage plasma potentials and the ionisation probabilities inside the thruster channel and confirmed the ideas the HEMP thruster concept is based upon. The integration over the angular and the energy distribution resulted in a thrust value of 12 mN, a total efficiency of 38\% and an effective swallow tail beam angle of 43\textdegree. Another surprising feature of DM3a MS1-3 has been its ability to turn on and off the neutraliser cathode with practically no impact on the thruster operational characteristics and its performance. At present a new HEMP thruster layout DM6 is under test. Current measurements on DM6 MS1 performed at TED Ulm by means of an own developed thermal diagnostic indicated further significant improvements. At 14 sccm, 600 V and 1.3 A, thrust, total efficiency and specific impulse were determined to be well above 30 mN, 55 \% and 2300 s, respectively. For Xe flows up to 8sccm DM6 MS1 could be stably operated at anode voltages of up to 1800 V, providing specific impulses well above 3500 s. Also operation of DM6 MS1 required no neutraliser cathode. It is intended to confirm these thermal diagnostic results on DM6 versions in the course of thrust balance tests to be performed at ONERA in February 03 the results of which shall be presented at the conference.}

This might be especially useful at a time where HEMP-Ts observe interest from spacecraft designers1,2, mission engineers and satellite operators, caused by the HEMP-Ts operational characteristics allowing reliable, low cost and low complexity EP systems. Though being a grid less device, the HEMP-T shows like a GIT a clear separation of ionization and ion acceleration zones. Therefore, performance similarities with GITs as e.g. high specific impulse ({$>$}3000 s) and high beam power efficiency ({$>$}80\%) are found. Otherwise the HEMP-T is clearly a magnetic device. With ExB areas in the cusp zones it shows similarities to HETs. But unlike HETs, the unique cusp/mirror magnetic field topology, created by a Permanent Periodic Magnet (PPM) stack, confines the discharge plasma off the dielectric thruster channel walls and is reason for the channel erosion free operation. A detailed comparison will be presented between GIT, HET and HEMP-T, based on their respective physical properties. A power balance model of the HEMP-T is provided, showing good agreement to the observed thermal losses and their locations at thruster anode and magnetic cusp zones. The model explains the advantages of the multistage compared to a single cusp thruster concept.}

The measurement of the radial ion saturation current density distribution in plasma using a double Langmuir probe for an axial magnetic field up to 16 mT, vacuum chamber pressure ranging from 4 \texttimes 10-5 to 2 \texttimes 10-3 and rf power from 100 to 900 W has been performed.

The plasma-treated zone can be visualized with the use of a test ink and quantitatively evaluated. However, the inked area is shrinking with time. The shrinkage characteristics are collected using activation image recording (AIR). The recording is conducted by a digital camera. The physical mechanisms of activation area shrinkage are discussed. The error sources are analyzed and methods of error reduction are proposed. The standard deviation of the activation area is less than 3\%. Three polymers, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and polyoxymethylene (POM), are examined as a test substrate material. Due to a wide variation range of SFE and a small hydrophobic recovery, HDPE is chosen. Since the chemical mixtures tend to temporal changes of the stoichiometry, the pure formamide test ink with 58 mN/m is selected. The method is tested for the characterization of five different types of discharge: (i) pulsed arc APPJ with the power of about 700 W; (ii) piezoelectric direct discharge APPJ; (iii) piezoelectric driven needle corona in ambient air; (iv) piezoelectric driven plasma needle in argon; and (v) piezoelectric driven dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). For piezoelectrically driven discharges, the power was either 4.5 W or 8 W. It is shown how the AIR method can be used to solve different engineering problems.},

Measuring the intensity of the Rayleigh/Mie scattering of the infrared signal we found a periodicity of dust formation/vanishing (period of about 35 min in our experimental conditions). The fast disappearance of the dust from the plasma region at the end of every period is the evidence of a narrow particle size distribution, as confirmed by secondary electron micrographs of the collected powder. Characteristic infrared absorption features have their origin in absorption within the dust particles. Besides the strong presence of aliphatic hydrocarbons characteristic for amorphous hydrocarbon films, a significant amount of aromatic structures was detected. Heavy positive ions measured by ion-mass spectroscopy originate from polyacetilenic (C2nH2) and aromatic compounds. Time resolved mass spectra gave insight into the plasma response to the dust formation.}

  abstract = {In this work we investigate how fluid plasma parameters are related to the kinetic plasma properties for plasmas with warm-ion sources and finite Debye lengths. This is an important issue in applying fluid codes to experimental, laboratory, technological and fusion plasmas. Namely, fluid codes for scrapeoff layer (SOL) region in fusion devices are applicable only up to the plasma\textendash sheath boundary (also called plasma edge or sheath entrance) and cannot be extended to the material boundaries themselves, because the sheath region is far from thermodynamic equilibrium and hence near the wall plasma can be correctly described only in terms of some kinetic model. Since, accordingly, the boundary conditions for plasma modeled in the fluid description should be defined at the plasma\textendash sheath boundary (rather than at the physical surfaces), this boundary needs to be appropriately identified. However, identifying such a boundary and calculating the hydrodynamic parameters there is a demanding task which up to now has been solved only approximately and for a limited number of plasma discharges (i.e., only for some particular particle and energy production and loss balance scenarios). In available PIC codes the ion source strength profile is usually hard-coded into program and does not change during the simulation (see e.g., Berkeley codes or BIT1). On the contrary, we have built very flexible PIC procedure enabling one to use different source strength profiles in each simulation step. In the present work we present the results obtained with the ion source strength profiles proportional to potential\textendash\textsuperscript{\^\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash Phi(x)\$}.We run simulation for cases with \textbackslash alpha = 0 and \textbackslash alpha = 1 and compare results of simulation with ``classic'' numerical results of Scheuer and Emmert (1988) [Scheuer, J.T., Emmert, G.A., 1988.

In this parametric study, hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) was dissociated under different plasma jet parameters.

The choice of the working gas plays a major role in the formation of nanoparticles and the surface texture. This study was focused on the particles growth and how the growth can be controlled by tuning the parameters mentioned. Particles size of up to 100 nm was achieved under optimized conditions.},

The two types of atmospheric-pressure plasma depositions of organosilicon films by the direct and indirect injection of hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) precursor into a plasma region were chosen and compared in terms of the films chemical composition and morphology to address this. Although different methods of plasma excitation were used, the deposition of inorganic films with above 98\% of SiO2 content was achieved for both cases. The chemical structure of the films was insignificantly dependent on the substrate type. The deposition in the afterglow of the DC discharge resulted in a soft film with high roughness, whereas RF plasma deposition led to a smoother film. In the case of the RF plasma deposition on polymeric materials resulted in films with delamination and cracks formation. Lastly, despite some material limitations, both deposition methods demonstrated significant potential for SiOx thin-films preparation for a variety of bio-related substrates, including glass, ceramics, metals, and polymers.},

Hybrid modelling (HM) is a technique which provides many opportunities to address both fundamental physics and practical matters of equipment design. HM is a hierarchical approach in which modules addressing different physical processes on vastly disparate timescales are iteratively combined using time-slicing techniques. By compartmentalizing the physics in each module to accept given inputs and produce required outputs, different algorithms can be used to represent the same physical processes. In this manner, the algorithms best suited for the conditions of interest can be used without affecting other modules. In this paper, the basis and implementation of HM are discussed using examples from simulations of inductively coupled plasmas.}

Furthermore, these arbitrary applied waveforms can produce a number of interesting phenomena that are not present in typical single-frequency sinusoidal discharges. This electrical asymmetry effect presents emerging possibilities for the improved control of the ion energy and ion flux in these systems; parameters of vital importance to both etching and deposition applications for materials processing. With a combined research approach utilizing both experimental measurements, and particle-in-cell simulations, we review and extend recent investigations that study a particular class of TVW. The waveforms used have a pulse-type shape and are composed of a varying number of harmonic frequencies. This allows a strong self-bias to be produced, and causes most of the applied voltage to be dropped across a single sheath. Additionally, decreasing the pulse width (by increasing the number of harmonics), allows the plasma density and ion flux to be increased. Simulation and experimental results both demonstrate that this type of waveform can be used to separately control the ion flux and ion energy, while still producing a uniform plasma over large area (50 cm diameter) rf electrodes.},

  abstract = {A two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation has been developed to study density enhancement of capacitively coupled rf discharges with multi-slit electrodes. The observed density increase is shown to result from a hollow cathode effect that takes place within the multi-slit electrode configuration, which forms as a result of secondary electron emission due to ion bombardment. By investigating the ionization and power deposition profiles, it is found that rfsheathheating is too weak to sustain the discharge, and that secondary electron acceleration within the sheath is the primary heating mechanism. Due to a capacitive voltage divider formed by the rfsheaths at each electrode, the area ratio of the powered and ground electrodes is observed to have a strong effect on the resulting discharge, and if the ground electrode area is too small, the voltage drop at the powered electrode is too low to sustain a hollow cathodedischarge.},

It has been found that the construction of the orthogonal acceleration TOF mass analyzer enables, in some cases, the simultaneous compensation of both ion spatial and initial velocity distributions by appropriate selection of ion-mirror potentials. This analytical result has been proved by numerical simulation of spectral line shapes. The influence of elementary cell dimensions of grids on the mass resolution has been investigated by the numerical integration of a large number of ion trajectories. The grids consisting of a set of parallel and equally spaced wires have been treated. Analytical approximations of the electrical field potential of the grids have been used. It has been found that optimization of TOF mass analyzers should include the treatment of ion scattering by grids.}

  abstract = {Plasma jets simultaneously create a wide range of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), making selective production challenging. In this study, an attempt was made to address this problem by adjusting the downstream length of the plasma jet to regulate reactive species production in an AC-driven argon plasma jet. Jets with short downstream lengths are dominated by RNS, whereas longer ones are dominated by ROS. The energy impact collision between energetic electrons and diffused ambient air is primarily responsible for the generation of RNS in argon plasma. Short plasma jets have a higher electron temperature in the plasma effluent, allowing for better excitation and ionization of N2 molecules. In contrast, in longer jets, electrons transfer most of their energy to neutrals and moisture, even before the diffusion of ambient air. Thus, the pro\- duction of OH radicals and H2O2 is dominant in longer plasma jets. Further, the ratio of NO2- to H2O2 in plasmaactivated water decreased from 1.8 to 0.07, as the downstream length was increased from 1 cm to 10 cm. RNSenriched short plasma jets are appropriate for immune cell activation, jets of intermediate length are suitable for gold nanoparticle formation because of the synergistic action of ROS and electron energy, and ROS-dominated longer plasma jets are excellent for methylene blue degradation. These findings are applicable to the design of plasma devices in which the generation of ROS and RNS in practical quantities is required to realize plasma technology for a wide range of applications.},

The results obtained by E. Q. Adams (unpublished), Epstein, Fry and Laue are discussed and summarized, certain errors are pointed out, and the equations are put in a form adapted to easy numerical calculation. Assuming the normal components of the velocities of the emitted electrons have the Maxwell distribution, the integration of Poisson's equation between proper limits leads to a numerical relation between the new variables ?=2(x-xm)[2?3e2i2m/k3T3]1/4 and ?=e(V-Vm)/kT, where xm and Vm give the position and voltage of the plane of minimum potential, and k is the Boltzmann gas constant. Denoting values at the cathode by the subscript 1, and inserting values of constants: ?1=log (i0/i), where i0 is the saturation current; V-V1=T(?-?1)/11,600, ?-?1=9.180\texttimes 105T-3/4i1/2(x-x1). These equations and the tables of ?(?) for various values of ? enable, for a given cathode temperature T, the potential distribution for a given current i, or vice versa, to be computed. An approximate solution for the current is: i=[(21/2/9?)(e/m)1/2(V-Vm)3/2/(x-xm)2](1+2.66?-1/2), which reduces to the usual three halves power law equation if we neglect Vm and xm and the correction factor in ?. (b) Equilibrium condition with anode at great distance, current zero. If the only retarding field is that of the space charge, the density of charge is: ?=kT?1/[(kT)1/2+x(2?e?1)1/2]2 where ?1=i0[2?m/kT]1/2. Except near the cathode this is approximately equal to kT/2?ex2; hence ? is proportional to the absolute temperature of the cathode and inversely proportional to the square of the distance away. The potential gradient at the cathode is X1=[8??1kT/e]1/2. Equations are also given for the case where an external retarding field X? is applied. II. In the case of concentric cylindrical electrodes, the current is: i=(81/2/9)(e/m)1/2[V-Vm+1/4V0log (V/?V0)2]3/2/r, where V0 is the initial energy of the electrons expressed in volts (3kT/2e), r is the radius of the anode, and ? is a constant between 1 and 2, not yet experimentally determined. The deviations from the three halves power law are not more than one quarter as much as for parallel planes and amount to only about 3 per cent at 130 volts.}

In this energy range ? increases with incident ion energy for all ions with the exception of protons for which a maximum is reached at around 110 keV. At constant energy the yield is progressively higher as the ion mass is increased up to that for oxygen. For neon, argon and krypton the yield at a constant energy is, however, less than that for oxygen. At a constant ion velocity, ? for atomic ions increases as the mass of the incident ion increases. Also, the rate of change of ? with ion velocity for these ions increases with increasing ion mass.

The surface morphology of the SWCNT thin films was observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The structural changes on the treated surfaces were detected by Raman spectroscopy. The changes in atomic composition for plasma-treated and pristine SWCNT film surfaces were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fluorescence analysis of the plasma-functionalized SWCNT surfaces was performed with green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). It was found that the transition from NH3/Ar to NH3/N2 gas system at other constant processing conditions resulted in increasing the CNT surface roughness, the degree of structural defects, the number of NH2-functional groups connected to the CNT surface and the bio-immobilization capability.

Results are compared with previous experiments of Ar\textendash He plasmas in which the argon ions were the heavier ion species.

  abstract = {A repeatable method based on conventional micro fabrication techniques for creating sharpened emitters from porous tungsten has been explored. A laboratory demonstration thruster comprised of 49 of these porous tungsten emitters has been built and tested. The demonstration device operates on the electrostatic field evaporation of ions from ionic liquids. The emitters are contained in three linear emitter arrays which have been shown to support an increase in current of over an order of magnitude when compared to solid cylindrical emitters. Time-of-flight mass spectrometry has be used to show that the emitted beam is purely ionic and is comprised of two species of ions in both positive and negative modes of operation. In addition, thrust measurements conducted on a torsional balance show that the demonstration device is capable of thrusts as high as 5.6 {$\mu$}N at a current of 48 {$\mu$}A and a voltage of 2437 volts for a specific impulse of above 3500 s.}

It presents the Paschen curve, and describes the predominant theories of spark formation. The chapter also discusses other breakdown phenomena, such as coronas and the hollow electrode carrier generation used in pseudosparks. Electrical breakdown occurs in a gas when a high-conductivity channel is formed between cathode and anode. Before a study is made of the behavior of gases under the influence of an electric field, it is appropriate to review the basic principles of the kinetic theory of gases pertinent to gaseous ionization and breakdown. From there, the various concepts of ionic and electronic can be inferred. The chapter further discusses the efficient use of gaseous insulation with intershields. It concludes by discussing the important aspects of breakdown behavior in gaseous SF6.},

  abstract = {Ions experience small deflections in the vicinity of grids in accelerators and ion mirrors in time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometers. Recent experiments with an orthogonal acceleration (oa) TOF instrument have verified that the effect can significantly degrade resolution when ions approach grids at an angle deviating from 90??. The phenomenon becomes significant only when ions have components of velocity at right angles to the wires of the grids. A model is presented in this study to predict this phenomenon for parallel wire grids. The fractional energy spread of ions (calculated in the static TOF-spectrometer frame of reference) scales directly with the approach angle of ions to the grid (as measured from normal approach). The energy spread also scales with the range of angles that is a consequence of the focusing effect in each gap between the wires of the grid. The equations imply that closely spaced parallel wire grids are best for deployment in oa-TOF systems where non-zero approach angles are unavoidable. Such grids are relatively impractical to manufacture and support but rectangular repeat cell grids with relatively few wires at right angles to the source axis are shown experimentally to introduce minimal energy spread. When these grids are rotated by 90??, the resolution measured in a Q-TOF spectrometer is degraded in approximate agreement with the parallel wire model. A practical implication of this work is that grid transmissions in oa-TOF systems may be significantly increased without loss of resolution. Improvements of ?200\% (V-mode) and ?400\% (W-mode) in ion transmission were obtained in this study without compromising resolution. This was achieved with ?73\% transmission grids and greater potential improvements in transmission are being realised since this study with ?89\% transmission grids having similar geometry.}

We evaluated possible reaction mechanisms by analyzing the correlation of gas phase, surface and plasma-produced species. Plasma feed gas compositions, plasma powers, and catalyst temperatures were varied to expand the experimental parameters. Real-time Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was applied to quantify gas phase species from the reactions. The reactive incident fluxes generated by plasma were measured by molecular beam mass spectroscopy using an identical APPJ operating at the same conditions. A strong correlation of the quantified fluxes of plasma-produced atomic oxygen with that of CH4 consumption, and CO and CO2 formation implies that O atoms play an essential role in CH4 oxidation for the investigated conditions. With the integration of APPJ, the apparent activation energy was lowered and a synergistic effect of 30\% was observed. We also performed in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy to analyze the catalyst surface. The surface analysis showed that surface CO abundance mirrored the surface coverage of CH n at 25 \textdegree C. This suggests that CH n adsorbed on the catalyst surface as an intermediate species that was subsequently transformed into surface CO. We observed very little surface CH n absorbance at 500 \textdegree C, while a ten-fold increase of surface CO and stronger CO2 absorption were seen. This indicates that for a nickel catalyst at 500 \textdegree C, the dissociation of CH4 to CH n may be the rate-determining step in the plasma-assisted CH4 oxidation for our conditions. We also found the CO vibrational frequency changes from 2143 cm-1 for gas phase CO to 2196 cm-1 for CO on a 25 \textdegree C catalyst surface, whereas the frequency of CO on a 500 \textdegree C catalyst was 2188 cm-1. The change in CO vibrational frequency may be related to the oxidation of the catalyst.},

The corresponding range-energy curve is computed. At higher ion energies the electronic excitation becomes increasingly important. An approximate formula is given for the electronic stopping contribution, increasing proportional to ion velocity at low and moderate velocities.

The apparent secondary electron yield (\textsubscript{\textbackslash rm se}) is deduced from the breakdown voltage between two parallel plate electrodes in a 360 mTorr argon environment using a simple Townsend breakdown model with the assumption that the variation of the apparent secondary electron yield is dominated by the variation of the argon ion induced processes. The oxygen coverage/oxide layer thickness on the aluminum cathode is measured by a semi in situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy equipment which is directly attached to the discharge chamber. It is found that three phases exist: (1) in the monomonolayer regime, as the oxygen coverage increases from 0 to 0.3, \textsubscript{\textbackslash rm se} decreases by nearly 40\%, (2) as the oxygen coverage increases from 0.3 to 1, \textsubscript{\textbackslash rm se} keeps nearly constant, (3) as the oxide layer thickness increases from about 0.3 nm to about 1.1 nm, \textsubscript{\textbackslash rm se} increases by 150\%. We propose that, in the submonolayer regime, the chemisorbed oxygen on the aluminum surface causes the decrease of \textsubscript{\textbackslash rm se} by creating a local potential barrier, which reduces the Auger neutralization rate and the energy gained by the Auger electrons. In the multilayer regime, as the oxide layer grows in thickness, there are three proposed mechanisms which cause the increase of \textsubscript{\textbackslash rm se}: (1) the work function decreases; (2) resonance neutralization and Auger de-excitation may exist. This is served as another channel for secondary electron production; (3) the kinetic energy of Auger electrons is increased on average, leading to a higher probability for electrons to overcome the surface potential barrier.},

The electron density, electron temperature and electron energy distribution function (EEDF) are measured at different O2 contents, gas pressures and applied powers. At fixed pressure and power, the electron density first drops quickly with the O2 ratio and then tends to saturate in the high O2 ratio range. The effective electron temperature exhibits completely opposite behaviors at low and high pressures. This is caused by the different evolving behaviors of low and high energy electrons of the EEDFs with the O2 ratio. Both the Langmuir probe and the global model predict that the electron density of O2/Ar mixed plasma first increases, peaks and then drops constantly, upon increasing the pressure. An analysis based on the simulation reveals that the non-monotonic variation of electron density with the pressure is due to the non-monotonic variation of the ionizations from both ground state O and metastable O*. Due to the strong ionizations, the electron density increases linearly with the power. The effective electron temperature is unchanged because the EEDF shape that determines the electron temperature is not varied upon increasing the power. The calculated electron density and temperature when varying the power agree better with the experiments at high pressure, i.e. 45 mTorr. The quantitative deviation between the model and the experiment when varying the pressure and the O2 ratio can be explained by two aspects. (1) The electron energy probability function is assumed to have a Maxwellian distribution in the global model while the realistic EEDFs vary significantly with the pressure and/or the O2 ratio, as revealed by the experiment. (2) The power transfer efficiency (i.e. the fraction of the power coupled into plasma) increases with the pressure.}

Based on simulation results obtained with this comprehensive model, the main species and reactions are identified, and simplified models capable of capturing the main physicochemical processes in He + H2O discharges are suggested. The accuracy of the simplified models is quantified and assessed for changes in water concentration, input power and electrode configuration. Simplified models can reduce the number of reactions by a factor of {$\sim$}10 while providing results that are within a factor of two of the detailed model. The simulation results indicate that Penning processes are the main ionization mechanism in this kind of discharge (1\textendash 3000 ppm of water), and water clusters of growing size are found to be the dominant charged species when the water concentration is above {$\sim$}100 ppm. Simulation results also predict a growing electronegative character of the discharge with increasing water concentration. The use of He + H2O discharges for the generation of reactive oxygen species of interest in biomedical applications and the green production of hydrogen peroxide are also discussed. Although it would be unrealistic to draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of these processes from a zero-dimensional global model, the results indicate the potential suitability of He + H2O plasmas for these two applications.},

  abstract = {Contact charging of micro- and nano-particles affords the Nanoparticle Field Extraction Thruster (NanoFET) flexibility to adjust its propellant's specific charge without an inherent impact on efficiency. Other than the particle size, two features in NanoFET's design also govern the range of achievable specific charges: the gate electrode configuration, which sets the charging electric fields and the resulting particle charge, and the particle mass density. Electrostatic simulations for various gate electrode configurations were conducted in COMSOL Multiphysics(R) to provide general scaling relations for the acquired particle charge as a function of gate geometry as well as particle size and proximity. The simulation results suggest that configurations with smaller gate aspect ratios, smaller relative particle sizes (compared to gate length scales), and larger extractor spacing-to-diameter ratios provide greater charging. The use of low mass density or hollow particles also enhances NanoFET's specific charge and gives the potential for moderate specific impulse and high thrust-to-power performance. Precise thrust control may also be possible using NanoFET's piezoelectric feed system to facilitate particle passage through the charging sieves, enable particle extraction, and regulate the mass flow rate.}

The effects of external discharge parameters, such as the frequency and power of the low frequency (LF) source and the gas pressure, on the IEDs are investigated in detail. With the increase in the LF power, the high-energy peak shifts towards the high-energy region and the energy width E between high- and low-energy peaks in the IEDs also increases. However, the increase in the LF frequency leads to the shift of the high-energy peak towards the low-energy region as well as a narrow energy width E. The increase in the gas pressure results in the bimodal structure being unobvious because of intensive momentum transfer and charge exchange collisions between ions and background molecules. In addition, the distinctions between Ar+ and O+2 IEDs are also discussed. Finally, some experimental results are compared with numerical ones obtained from the particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo (PIC/MC) method and both results are in general agreement.},

Most of the design, modeling, and experimental work to date have involved a dielectric liquid intended as the medium to suspend the conductive particles and transport them from storage areas to particle extraction sites. This paper discusses the physics and performance modeling approaches for nanoFET?s dielectric liquid configuration. Particle charging and lift-off from the charging electrode are examined in the context of recent laboratory tests of a microparticle emitter prototype. This paper also presents a nanoFET experiment conducted by undergraduate students in microgravity conditions onboard a NASA C-9 aircraft. Data from this experiment confirmed the function of knife-edged orifices in pinning liquid surfaces in microgravity. Limited measurements of threshold electric fields for liquid surface instability agree well with theory suggesting an inverse relationship between orifice size and the threshold electric field in microgravity.}

The plasma momentum flux sensor measured the force exerted onto it by the Hall effect thruster exhaust plume with a resolution of 0.1 mN and an average discrepancy of 2\% compared with thrust stand measurements. Experiments were completed using a 9m by 6m cylindrical vacuum chamber. The total force from the Hall effect thruster was modulated from 34 to 356 mN by varying both the anode voltage, from 150 to 500 V, and the neutral Xe gas flow rate, from 5 to 15 mg/s.}

  abstract = {A new model of the plasma plume from Hall effect thrusters (HETs) has been developed for the purpose of more accurately predicting the interactions between future high-power thrusters and large high-voltage solar arrays, such as those being developed under NASA's Game Changing Technology awards by ATK and Deployable Space Systems. The HET plume mainly consists of two types of ions. The first are the energetic main beam ions produced upstream of the thruster acceleration zone. These are the dominant ion species along the thrust axis. The other group of ions have lower kinetic energy and are generated downstream of the acceleration zone from neutral xenon gas atoms by charge exchange (CEX) with main beam ions and by electron impact ionization. The neutral gas is due to neutral propellant atoms leaving the thruster and the hollow cathode without being ionized, and, in the case of laboratory testing, background neutrals present in the vacuum chamber. The new model uses the 2-D axisymmetric Hall thruster code, Hall2De, to self-consistently calculate the three major components of the plume in the vicinity of the thruster, which are the neutral gas atoms, high-energy beam ions, and low-energy ions. From the boundary computational region in the near plume, the Hall2De results are propagated to distances of tens of meters using a continuum hydrodynamic algorithm. This approach offers important advantages with respect to prior models of Hall thruster plumes, such as the NASA Electric Propulsion Interactions Code (EPIC), which uses an analytical fit to laboratory data from a single thruster for the main beam velocity boundary conditions at the channel exit. EPIC assumes that the neutral gas density emanates uniformly and isotropically from the channel exit. Low-energy ions are generated only by CEX; low-energy ions generated by electron impact are not included. The results for the far-field plume of a conceptual high-power thruster (H6) show important differences between EPIC and simulations using the new plume model. High-energy ions undergo less expansion in the azimuthal direction than in EPIC. This can be attributed to magnetic focusing of the beam. We also observe that the peak in low-energy ion density at approximately 90\textdegree{} from the thrust axis predicted by EPIC is moved downstream to angles from 70\textdegree{} to 80\textdegree{} when the new plume model is employed.}

In spite of the effort by the end of the 70s the programs were stopped in the USA and Europe before any design had gotten to fly in space. An exhaustive study of the literature has been performed to identify what were the reasons behind the disappearance of Colloid Thrusters. Apart from programmatic reasons related to the introduction of the Space Shuttle, some technical reasons where identified. The technical difficulties had to do with the use of arrays of needles. Aiming at overcoming these difficulties, an alternative way to construct Colloid Thrusters has been proposed. Instead of needles, holes in Teflon where used. This has been tested both numerically and experimentally with positive results. This development may be useful not only for colloid propulsion but also for other technologies that require electrospray emission.},

Generally, the fabrication of high-quality VO2 films requires a high deposition temperature over 400 \textdegree C which limits its large scale implementation as well as its compatibility with temperature-sensitive substrates. In this work, we demonstrate the deposition of thermochromic VO2 thin films on flexible polymer substrates using High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS); this process is known for its high degree of ionization, high plasma density and hence high ion flux towards the substrate that allows one to deposit crystalline films at lower temperatures in comparison with conventional sputtering techniques. We first describe the optimization approach of the HiPIMS process followed by the optical performance study of the resulting VO2 films on Kapton polyimide substrates. The films deposited at temperatures as low as 275 \textdegree C are then analyzed by means of temperature-resolved spectrophotometry, XPS, ERD, RBS, Raman spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Optimized films show an infrared modulation {$\Delta$}T2500 nm of up to 50\% with a transition temperature Tc close to the bulk temperature of 68 \textdegree C.},

The measurements reveal that methyl groups (CH3), abundantly formed by the dissociation of the HMDSO molecule, are the precursor for the most abundant species which stem from two kinds of reaction. The first kind of reaction is combustion of CH3 by oxygen-producing formaldehyde (COH2), formic acid (CO2H2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. It is shown that high mass carbonated radicals, such as SixOyCzHt , first diffuse to the surface and then the carbon is removed by oxygen etching to form CO2. The second is hydrocarbon chemistry promoted by CH3, producing mainly hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4) and acetylene (C2H2).},

  abstract = {A radially outward acceleration of plasma in cylindrical geometry along an applied electric field and across an axial magnetic field is studied. The configuration, coined a radial plasma source, consists of two ceramic disks positioned parallel to each other, between which a cylindrical molybdenum anode is mounted. The electric field is generated by applying a voltage between the anode and a heated cathode neutralizer that is located away from the ceramic disks. The plasma diagnostic system includes Langmuir probes, an emissive probe, and a balance force meter. The discharge voltage is found to increase when the magnetic field is increased or when the mass flow rate  and the pressure  is decreased. For a discharge current of 1.4 A, the discharge voltage increases from 55 to 120 V when the magnetic field is increased from 0 to 186 G. The azimuthal uniformity of the plasma flow is found to decrease with the increase in gas pressure. The force exerted on the balance force meter is found to be larger than the force exerted by the plasma flow. This disparity indicates that a considerable part of the force is exerted by the neutral gas, which has gained momentum from the plasma via ion-neutral collisions. The force is increased because the momentum delivered for a given deposited power is larger if the energy is deposited in a larger mass, as happens here through plasma collisions. We estimate theoretically the expected force at the collisionless and the collisional limits and find that the measured force is between the expected forces at the two limits.}

  abstract = {Atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) are a promising tool in medicine with extensive possibilities of utilization. For a safe and therapeutically effective application of APPJs, it is necessary to know in detail the physical processes in plasma as well as possible hazards. In this paper, we focus on plasma thermal energy transferred to the substrate, i.e. to a passive thermal probe acting as substrate dummy. Specifically, we examined the dependence of transferred energy on the distance from the plasma source outlet, on the gas flow rate, and on the length of the visible plasma plume. The plasma plume is the plasma carried by the gas flow from the outlet of the source into the ambient air. The results show the distance between the plasma-generating device and the substrate to be the most important determinant of the transferred thermal energy, among the three examined variables. Most importantly for the end-user, the results also show this relation to be non-linear. To describe this relation, we chose a model based on a Boltzmann type of sigmoid function. Based on the results of our modelling and visual inspection of the plasma, we provide sort of a user guide for the adjustment of a suitable energy flux on the (bio) substrate.},

The calculations for the ions are performed using a Monte Carlo method that includes charge exchange and elasticscattering. The contribution of both collision processes to the angular ion impact energy distribution is studied. For the case that charge exchange is the only collision process, the Monte Carlo results can be checked against those of a method based on a spatially uniform and time independent collision rate. In that case, both methods yield the same ion impact energy distribution. The position, velocity, and propagation angle of the energetic neutrals created in collisions of ions with the background gas are stored. These are used as input data for a separate code that follows the evolution of the angular neutral energy distribution, taking into account (multiple) neutral elasticscattering. From the ion and neutral distributions, the number of neutrals per ion, the average impact energy, and the energy-weighted average impact angle have been derived. It is shown that these parameters are well described by simple expressions. Finally, the sputter yield is calculated. The results show that the contribution of the angular distributions of both ions and neutrals to the yield can be neglected.},

Results are shown for 13.56 MHz discharges in Ar, Ar/H2, N2, O2, Cl2, and SF6/He over a pressure range of 0.3\textendash 40 Pa. The ion impact energy distribution consists of a collision-free part and a collision-induced part. It is observed that in Ar, N2, O2, and Cl2 the collision?induced part contains single and double peaks at regular energy intervals. This peaked structure is attributed to charge exchange processes in the sheath. Both the collision-free part and the collision?induced part of the ion impact energy distribution are well described by a model based on a constant sheath width, a sinusoidal sheath voltage, and a power law for the electric field in the sheath. The only adjustable parameter in the model is the sheath thickness. The sheath thickness has also been determined independently from the total ion current density using the Child\textendash Langmuir law. The obtained values are in good quantitative agreement with each other and with the observed optical sheath thickness, demonstrating the overall consistency of the present approach.}

Improvements to the electronic detection system have been undertaken including a computer-based, data acquisition system and new particle detection sensor electronics. These sensors have additional amplifiers that extend the range of charge detection to 1\texttimes 10\textsuperscript{-12\$} C allowing for the detection of larger particles. Improvements to the vacuum system have also been made. The accelerator beam line is now pumped with an oil-free, turbomolecular pump reducing possible problems with hydrocarbon contamination.

Aluminum samples were exposed to quantified beams of argon ions up to 2000 eV and to oxygen atoms and molecules in order to mimic the plasma-surface interactions on metallic targets during reactive sputtering. The variation of electron emission yield was correlated to the ion energy and to the oxidation state of Al surfaces. This system provides reliable measurements of the electron yields in real time and is of great utility to explore the fundamental surface processes during target poisoning occurring in reactive magnetron sputtering applications.},

Four FEEP emitters with three different slit height values were tested. Thrust produced covered the 1\textendash 170 mN range. Repeatability of thruster performance was found to depend on the degree of wetting of the emitter slit and on the presence of glow discharge between the electrodes. The latter represented an undesired effect and was therefore eliminated after the . rst series of experiments. Wetting, on the contrary, proved to be of the utmost importance. In some cases, thruster performance improved by up to as much as 150\% within a few days of the beginning of the test, as a result of enhanced slit wetting.}

This mixed composition provides the first direct evidence for a clumpy density structure of the grain-forming region. The silicates in total encompass 56.5\% +- 1.4\% of the identified dust mass, while corundum takes up 38+-3 wt.\%. Depending on the choice of continuum, a range of mass fractions is observed for periclase ranging from 2.7\% +- 1.7\% in the most conservative case to 9\% +- 2\% in a less-constrained continuum. In addition, we identify a feature at 11.2 mm as the crystalline silicate forsterite, with only a minor contribution from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The 5\% +- 3\% crystalline silicate fraction requires high temperatures such as those found in the immediate quasar environment in order to counteract rapid destruction from cosmic rays.}

  abstract = {This contribution presents a short review of electric propulsion (EP) technologies for satellites and spacecraft. Electric thrusters, also termed ion or plasma thrusters, deliver a low thrust level compared to their chemical counterparts, but they offer significant advantages for in-space propulsion as energy is uncoupled to the propellant, therefore allowing for large energy densities. Although the development of EP goes back to the 1960s, the technology potential has just begun to be fully exploited because of the increase in the available power aboard spacecraft, as demonstrated by the very recent appearance of all-electric communication satellites. This article first describes the fundamentals of EP: momentum conservation and the ideal rocket equation, specific impulse and thrust, figures of merit and a comparison with chemical propulsion. Subsequently, the influence of the power source type and characteristics on the mission profile is discussed. Plasma thrusters are classically grouped into three categories according to the thrust generation process: electrothermal, electrostatic and electromagnetic devices. The three groups, along with the associated plasma discharge and energy transfer mechanisms, are presented via a discussion of long-standing technologies like arcjet thrusters, magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters, pulsed plasma thrusters and ion engines, as well as Hall thrusters and variants. More advanced concepts and new approaches for performance improvement are discussed afterwards: magnetic shielding and wall-less configurations, negative ion thrusters and plasma acceleration with a magnetic nozzle. Finally, various alternative propellant options are analyzed and possible research paths for the near future are examined.},

Following a thorough literature survey, three probe architectures have been selected: a planar probe (PP), a planar probe with a guard ring (PPGR) and a Faraday cup (F). The geometrical ion collection area and the collector material are the same for the three instruments. The ion probes have been installed on a rotating arm in the PIVOINE-2G test bench of the ICARE laboratory, which allows data acquisition over a 180\$\^\textbackslash circ\$ angle. Measurements have been performed in the plume of the 1.5 kW-class PPS 1350-ML Hall thruster, a laboratory version of the PPS 1350-G developed and built by SAFRAN. Ion current density angular distributions have been acquired in the Hall thruster plume for a broad range of discharge voltages and xenon mass ?ow rates. The impact of the background pressure has also been investigated. The influence of the probe architecture upon ion profile and associated quantities will be discussed in this contribution. Recommendations for the design of an "ideal" ion current probe as well as methodology and guidelines for probe operation and data treatment are provided after the critical examination of all experimental outcomes. This works a first step towards the standardization of EP device plume measurements in simulated space environment, an essential phase towards improving the reliability of comparisons between di?erent thrusters and di?erent vacuum chambers and towards furnishing high-quality data for validation of numerical simulations.}

Although the design of a HT is relatively simple, the physical mechanisms that govern thrust generation and efficiency are not yet fully understood.

The VDF of xenon and krypton\textendash the most common propellants\textendash is therefore locally interrogated by means of LIF on excited levels. In this review emphasis is placed on time-averaged and time-resolved continuous-wave LIF measurements, associated quantities and recent outcomes.

These plasmas create cocktails of ROS containing ozone, singlet oxygen, atomic oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxyl radicals, i.e. ROS of great significance as recognized by the free-radical biology community. By means of one-dimensional fluid simulations (61 species, 878 reactions), the key ROS and their generation and loss mechanisms are identified as a function of the oxygen and water content in the feed gas. Identification of the main chemical pathways can guide the optimization of He + O2 + H2O plasmas for the production of particular ROS. It is found that for a given oxygen concentration, the presence of water in the feed gas decreases the net production of oxygen-derived ROS, while for a given water concentration, the presence of oxygen enhances the net production of water-derived ROS. Although most ROS can be generated in a wide range of oxygen and water admixtures, the chemical pathways leading to their generation change significantly as a function of the feed gas composition. Therefore, care must be taken when selecting reduced chemical sets to study these plasmas.},

  abstract = {Ambient molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) has been used to study how different capillary widths (530 \textmu m and 2.4 mm) and excitation waveforms (continuous wave kHz and pulsed dc) affect the ionic composition of atmospheric pressure plasma jets. It is shown from time-averaged ion intensities that reducing the width of the jet capillary results in a significant increase in the variety of both positive and negative ions detected within the discharge. We discuss this in terms of changes in flow velocity and the onset of turbulence within the plasma plume. Changing the mode of excitation had little effect on the ionic species detected from the microplasma jet; however, there was a notable shift in dominance towards higher mass ions when operated in a continuous wave kHz mode. The temporal evolution of the ions within the microplasma jet was observed for both excitation sources, operated at 5 and 15 kHz. Positive ions were created during periods correlated with the positive and negative peaks in discharge current, while negative ions were predominantly created at times when the discharge current peak was negative. This phenomenon was independent of the driving waveform. For pulsed dc excitation, considerably fewer positive ions were created in periods related to the negative current peaks, especially at higher frequencies. We propose a simple explanation for these processes based on ideas of streamer propagation and the influence of self-induced electric fields in the plasma plume.},

A hybrid simulation where ions are treated as particles and electrons as a fluid obeying the Boltzmann relation is used to investigate ion heating in the plasma presheath. At low pressure (below a few mTorr), the ion velocity distribution is Maxwellian in the bulk and becomes a drifting Maxwellian distribution while transiting the presheath. The distribution remains essentially isotropic as the ions are accelerated through the presheath to satisfy the Bohm criterion. At intermediate pressures (around 10mTorr), ion-neutral collisions scatter a significant part of the ion kinetic energy from the parallel direction to the perpendicular direction, leading to a net heating of the ions. In addition, the ion velocity distribution becomes distinctly anisotropic. At higher pressure (above a few tens of mTorr), ion heating is still observed, but yields isotropic ion velocity distributions.}

The measurements were carried out over a wide range of pressures (30-300 Pa) and discharge voltages (20-400 V). The correlation between these two diagnostic methods is investigated. The alpha to gamma transition can be seen in the sudden change both in the measured electron-energy distribution function and in the line intensities with increasing discharge voltage. The observed dramatic lowering of the electron temperature in the gamma mode (the secondary-electron-dominated mode) results in extreme differences in the optical emission between singlet and triplet helium lines due to spin-changing collisions of electrons and metastable atoms. It is deduced, using two different electrode materials (aluminium and stainless steel), that secondary electrons and metastable atoms play the dominant role in the formation of the two discharge modes. Furthermore, the probe measurement data are shown to be in very good agreement with those recently reported by Godyak et al. (1992).},

Discharge diagnosis and monitoring was assured by electrical measurements and optical emission spectroscopy. Molecular beam mass spectrometry is engaged to sample positive ions populations from two different plasma sources.

In the high-temperature release region, an implantation energy-dependent shift in desorption temperatures is observed after implantation to very low fluences. It is explained by the variation of the mean distance from the surface for atoms implanted at different energies rather than by changes in the activation energy for detrapping. Morphological investigations of the surface of polycrystalline beryllium after several implantation and annealing cycles show a strong dependence of the damage on the surface orientation of grains. This dependence correlates with the preferred diffusion of interstitials parallel to basal planes of the beryllium lattice as calculated within the formalism of density functional theory.},

The important role played by atomic oxygen adsorbed on satellite surfaces has been revealed by the analysis of data from orbiting mass spectrometers and pressure gauges. Data from satellites of special design have yielded information on the energy accommodation and angular distributions of molecules reemitted from satellite surfaces. Consequently, it is now possible to calculate satellite drag coefficients from basic physical principles, utilizing parameters of gas\textendash surface interactions measured in orbit. The results of such calculations are given. They show the drag coefficients of four satellites of different compact shapes in low-earth orbit with perigee altitudes in the range from about 150 to 300 km, where energy accommodation coefficients and diffuse angular distributions have been measured. The calculations are based on Sentman's analysis of drag forces in free-molecular flow. His model incorporates the random thermal motion of the incident molecules, and assumes that all molecules are diffusely reemitted The uncertainty caused by the assumption of diffuse reemission is estimated by using Schamberg's model of gas\textendash surface interaction, which can take into account a quasi-specular component of the reemission. Such a quasi-specular component is likely to become more important at higher altitudes as the amount of adsorbed atomic oxygen decreases. A method of deducing accommodation coefficients and angular distributions at higher altitudes by comparing the simultaneous orbital decay of satellites of different shapes at a number of altitudes is suggested. The purpose is to improve thermospheric measurements and models, which are significantly affected by the choice of drag coefficients.},

It takes into account compositional changes both due to the spatial distribution of target atoms deposited in collision cascades, and due to the presence of the implanted ions. The local density of the target is allowed to relax according to a given function of the densities of the individual components. The applications of the program cover a wide range of problems like the collisional atomic mixing of multilayered targets, dynamic implantation profiles at large fluences, and the fluence-dependent preferential sputtering of multicomponent materials. The present paper provides a description of the program and a critical comparison to similar Monte Carlo codes. As an application, the behaviour of the Ta-C system under He bombardment is studied with respect to sputtering yields, surface composition and composition profiles. Satisfactory agreement is obtained with experimental results given in the literature.}

Velocities were measured both parallel and perpendicular to the wafer over an energy range of 0.4\textendash 600?eV. The resulting fluorescence was recorded using a fast CCD camera, which provided resolution of 0.4?mm in space and 30?ns in time. Data were taken at eight different phases during the 2.2?MHz cycle. The ion velocity distributions (IVDs) in the sheath were found to be spatially non-uniform near the edge of the wafer and phase-dependent as a function of height. Several cm above the wafer the IVD is Maxwellian and independent of phase. Experimental results were compared with simulations.

A fast (30?ns exposure) charge coupled device camera measures the resulting fluorescence with a spatial resolution of 0.4?mm. The dual-frequency bias on the wafer is comprised of a 2?MHz low frequency (LF) bias and a 19?MHz high frequency bias. The laser is phase locked to the LF bias and IVD measurements are taken at several different LF phases. Ion energy distribution (IED) function measurements and calculated moments are compared for several cases. IEDs were measured at two disparate phases of the phase-locked LF bias. IEDs were found to be multipeaked and were well-approximated by a sum of Maxwellian distributions. The calculated fluxes in the dual frequency case were found to be substantially more radially uniform than the single frequency bias case. For industrial applications, this radially uniform ion flux is evidently a trade off with the undesirable multipeaked structure in the IEDs.}

A two-dimensional, free boundary fluid code, RIPPLE, was modified to account for this flux and used to give an initial estimate of the seriousness of this effect. Lithium films are dramatically affected, to such a degree that their use in an LM divertor is seriously questioned. Gallium films withstand the momentum flux much better, with speeds of around 1 m s-1 giving adequate performance in a realistic CDA divertor momentum flux profile. The inclusion of magnetohydrodynamic forces, not present in this initial estimation, is required to describe fully the LM film response.}

A disk-shaped set of electrodes mounted on the inside of a meter-scale vacuum chamber provides the energy to break a neutral gas, provided at the electrodes only, down into a plasma. The plasma starts as eight loops, and then self-organizes into a single magnetically driven collimated plasma jet. This thesis explores the dynamic evolution of that plasma jet and how changes made to the jet power source or environment alter the evolution. The most significant finding is the discovery that a series of instabilities can lead to magnetic reconnection. The jet undergoes a first, primary instability, called the kink instability. The exponential growth of kink amplitude provides an acceleration that drives a smaller scale, secondary instability, called the Rayleigh\textendash Taylor instability. The Rayleigh\textendash Taylor instability can drop the diameter of the plasma to a small enough scale to allow magnetic reconnection. A second set of experiments explores the range of collision interactions between the plasma jet and a cloud of neutral gas in its path. A final set of experiments shows the dependence of jet radius on a time-changing current. A new power supply that led to the observation of some of these new dynamics is also described.},

  abstract = {Energy distributions of neutral atoms sputtered from elemental Cu and two binary alloys (Cu\_0.53 W\_0.47 and Ni\_0.92 W\_0.08) under steady-state conditions were investigated both by experiments and by computer simulations. Ar+ ions with impact energies ranging from 65 to 1030 eV were used as bombarding species. The experimental data were recorded with a secondary-neutral mass spectrometer that combines electron-gas post-ionization with a high-transmission double focusing mass spectrometer. Due to the instrument's high detection sensitivity, the energy spectra could be determined over a large intensity range, covering up to five orders of magnitude. A comparable (or even) larger emission-energy range could be monitored in the computer simulations which were done with the dynamic TRIDYN code. The computed energy spectra are in qualitative agreement with the corresponding experimental distributions. Not surprisingly, the data from both approaches indicate that the inverse-square emission-energy dependence of the yield predicted by analytical sputtering theory is generally not valid for the low (near-threshold) impact energies used in this work and for emission energies approaching the maximum possible values. Rather, the energy spectra exhibit, over a considerable energy range, an exponentially decreasing yield with increasing emission energy. The large range of emission energies detected provided the opportunity to derive estimates of the maximum emission energy and its dependence on the primary-ion energy E for the various atomic species. These values amount to 0.55E for Cu and Ni atoms and to 0.35E for W atoms sputtered from the alloys and to 0.6E for Cu atoms sputtered from the pure Cu specimen; they are compared to simple estimates of the maximum emission energies in low-energy sputtering based on collision sequences leading to the ejection events that involve only a small number of atoms.}

  abstract = {The first report of a discharge in a hollow cathode was by F. Paschen in 1916. That study showed that such a system was capable of producing a high electron flux and relatively low ion and neutral temperatures. About 40 years later, the work of Lidsky and others showed that hollow cathode arc discharges were one of the best plasmas sources available at that time. The term "hollow cathode discharges" has commonly been used in reference to almost any discharge in a cathode with a cavity-like geometry, such that the plasma was enclosed or partially bound by the electrode walls that were at the cathode potential. Just as the magnetic field trapping of the electrons in a magnetron cathode results in an increase in the plasma density, in the hollow cathode, the reduced electron loss due to the geometry of the cathode also results in a higher plasma density. At least three types of discharge can be established in a hollow cathode. At low power and/or at relatively low gas pressures, the plasma is a "conventional" discharge characterized by low currents and medium to high voltages (we will call this a discharge in a hollow cathode or D-HC). Even this type of plasma has a higher density than a normal planar parallel-plate or magnetron system because the hollow geometry strongly reduces the loss of electrons. Using an adequate combination of gas pressure and applied power with a given hollow cathode diameter, or separation of the cathode surface, the negative glow of the plasma can expand to occupy the majority of the interior volume of the cathode. Under this condition the plasma current can, for the same voltage, be 100 to 1000 times the value of the "simple" D-HC discharge, and the plasma density is correspondingly larger (we call this a hollow cathode discharge or HCD). If the cathode is not cooled, the discharge can transform into a dispersed arc as the electrode temperature increases and thermal-field electron emission becomes an important additional source of electrons (we will call this a hollow cathode arc or HCA). The accepted explanation for the HCD phenomenon involves the existence of high-energy "pendulum" electrons, which are reflected from the sheaths on either side of the cathode; the long trajectory of this electron is understood to produce a large number of secondary electrons, with this resulting in the high plasma density and plasma current. We describe the structure of a parallel-plate discharge, particularly the gas phase and cathode surface excitation and ionization collision processes. Using this description, we discuss some of the problems associated with the conventional hollow cathode model and we propose a new explanation that has important implications for the physics and applications of hollow cathodes. In the last section of this review, we describe how hollow cathodes have and can be used to deposit thin films and nanostructured coatings. We provide an extensive and approximately chronological listing of how hollow cathodes have been successfully used to deposit materials, mainly by sputtering and plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition based techniques.},

As an original objective, we explore the effects of humid air impurity on the biologically relevant reactive species in an oxygen-dependent system. After a few milliseconds in the afterglow environment, the densities of atomic oxygen (O) decreases from 1015 to 1013 cm-3 and singlet delta molecular oxygen (O2(1D)) of the order of 1015 cm-3 decreases by a factor of two, while the ozone (O3) density increases from 1014 to 1015 cm-3. Electrons and oxygen ionic species, initially of the order of 1011 cm-3, recombine much faster on the time scale of some microseconds. The formation of atomic hydrogen (H), hydroxyl radical (OH), hydroperoxyl (HO2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitric oxide (NO) and nitric acid (HNO3) resulting from the humid air impurity as well as the influence on the afterglow chemistry is clarified with particular emphasis on the formation of dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS). The model suggests that the reactive species predominantly formed in the afterglow are major ROS O2(1D) and O3 (of the order of 1015 cm-3) and rather minor hydrogen- and nitrogen-based reactive species OH, H2O2, HNO3 and NO2/NO3, of which densities are comparable to the O-atom density (of the order of 1013 cm-3). Furthermore, the model quantitatively reproduces the experimental results of independent O and O3 density measurements.},

Increasing the particles' charge-to-mass ratios is critical for maximizing their velocities when accelerated with applied electric fields, which requires minimizing the particles' sizes down to the micro- and nanometer ranges for some applications. An analysis reveals that the charge-to-mass ratio is maximized with low aspect ratio particles when the maximum electric field strength, which is at the top of the particles, is held constant. Experimental results of charging titanium and aluminum spherical and cylindrical particles are presented, which suggest that under appropriate conditions, the particles are charged as predicted by theory. But that electrical contact resistance between the particles and electrode can influence the charging time. An analysis of the expected particle charging times is presented, which shows a strong dependence on the conductivity and thickness of the oxide layer coating the particles.}

  year = {2009},
  abstract = {A new electrostatic propulsion system that utilizes micro- and nano-particles is under development. At its core, multi-layer grids establish electric fields that charge and accelerate the particles. Before charging, the particles are transported to charging/accelerating zones from storage reservoirs. One method of transport delivers the particles suspended in liquid through microfluidic channels. Another method transports the particles through micro-sieves as a dry powder. Advantages over current technologies include the ability to tune its operational parameters over a large range, elimination of life-limiting characteristics, and increased design flexibility. Note that other applications such as materials processing and nanoprinting may also benefit from emitted high-energy particles. This thesis investigates several limiting obstacles, which are associated with charging particles, extracting particles from liquids, and overcoming adhesion/cohesion of particles. The results provide new direction towards the final thruster design concept. Here, the obstacles under discussion include: - The ability to accurately charge the particles and to maximize their charge-to-mass ratios is investigated. Theoretical analyses and simulations suggest that restricting the maximum electric field at the particles' surfaces is a necessary condition to avoid breakdown or field emission. With this constraint, spheres obtain greater charge-tomass ratios than cylinders because they more uniformly distribute charge over their surfaces. Experimental results suggest that the charging models are reasonable under appropriate conditions. - When transporting particles in a liquid suspension, the ability to extract them with an electric force while preventing the liquid from becoming unstable is critical. Theoretical modeling and experimentation prove that both spherical and cylindrical particles can be extracted successfully. But, it may not be possible to extract particles smaller than the micron range without inducing an instability, which leads to the formation of Taylor cones and limits thruster performance. - When transporting and emitting dry particles, preventing particle adhesion/cohesion is important. Theoretical models developed here, which are supported by experimental results, suggest that an electric force can be use to overcome the adhesion of particles in the nanometer range. A functional micro-sieve thruster prototype capable of operating continuously has demonstrated the ability to overcome adhesion/cohesion in the micron range.},

The no-liquid approach potentially provides important advantages such as allowing the use of smaller particles for propellant, which may offer a greater specific impulse. The most likely developmental obstacles are the adhesion of the particles to the source electrode and the cohesion between the particles. Adhesion and cohesion models are presented along with proposed methods of overcoming each. A method of using the applied charging electric field to overcome the adhesion force is investigated, which predicts that it may be possible to remove particles with diameters down to hundreds or even tens of nanometers from a planar electrode with only the application of a high strength electric field. To investigate this particle removal model, eight test cases, involving 4 particle sizes and 2 electrode materials, are presented. A method of transporting the dry particle propellant through an ultra-fine sieve prior to the charging and accelerating stages is investigated as a method of overcoming the cohesion between the particles. A simple proof-of-concept experiment is presented which indicates that this method is capable of breaking the cohesion force under appropriate conditions, which helps to guide future research.}

A use of NMC-seed layers remarkably improves electrical transport properties of subsequently deposited ZnO:Al contacts. In this work, crystallisation of quasi-amorphous, nitrogen doped ZnO seed layers has been performed using water vapours at overpressure and temperatures around 100 \textdegree C. This approach allows employment of soda-lime float-glass or temperature sensitive film stacks as a substrate. We propose here possible mechanism of water-assisted NMC and grope for optimised crystallisation conditions on the basis of optical, microscopic, and textural investigation. Low temperature water-assisted crystallisation of 20 nm thick ZnO layers was compared with high temperature annealing methods in terms of composition, microstructure and crystallinity. Electrical properties such as electron Hall mobility ({$\mu$}e), concentration of free electrons (Ne) and sheet resistance (Rsh) have been evaluated and compared for functional ZnO:Al films obtained on glass and on differently crystallised NMC-seed layers. It was found that the crystallised with water assistance at low temperature ZnO seed layers provide comparable improvement in crystallinity and electrical properties of subsequently grown functional ZnO:Al films with respect to the ones crystallised at high temperature. Use of optimised water-assisted crystallisation of seed layers has allowed decreasing Rsh of thin (130\textendash 270 nm) functional ZnO:Al films twice compared to the glass substrate. Both provide this effect: increase in {$\mu$}e and increase of Ne.},

  abstract = {A simple, compact cantilever force probe (CFP) has been developed for plasma pressure measurements. It is based on the pull-in phenomenon well known in microelectromechanical-system electrostatic actuators. The probe consists of a thin (25?{$\mu$}m) titanium foil cantilever (38 mm of length and 14 mm of width) and a fixed electrode separated by a 0.75 mm gap. The probe is shielded by brass box and enclosed into boron nitride housing with a 9 mm diameter window for exposing part of cantilever surface to the plasma. When the voltage is applied between the cantilever and the electrode, an attractive electrostatic force is counterbalanced by cantilever restoring spring force. At some threshold (pull-in) voltage the system becomes unstable and the cantilever abruptly pulls toward the fixed electrode until breakdown occurs between them. The threshold voltage is sensitive to an additional externally applied force, while a simple detection of breakdown occurrence can be used to measure that threshold voltage value. The sensitivity to externally applied forces obtained during calibration is 0.28 V/{$\mu$}N (17.8?V/Pa for pressure). However, the resolution of the measurements is \$\textbackslash pm0.014\$ mN (\$\textbackslash pm0.22\$ Pa) due to the statistical scattering in measured pull-in voltages. The diagnostic temporal resolution is 10?ms, being determined by the dynamics of pull-in process. The probe has been tested in the tokamak ISTTOK edge plasma, and a plasma force of 0.07?mN (plasma pressure 1.1 Pa) has been obtained near the leading edge of the limiter. This value is in a reasonable agreement with the estimations using local plasma parameters measured by electrical probes. The use of the described CFP is limited by a heat flux of Q 10\^6 W/m\^2 due to uncontrollable rise of the cantilever temperature (\$\textbackslash Delta T\$ 20 \textdegree C) during CFP response time.}

Furthermore, an overview on source plasma and ion beam characterisation methods is presented. Apart from that, a beam profile modelling strategy with the help of numerical trajectory codes as basis for a special grid system design is outlined. This modelling represents the basis for the adaptation of a grid system for required technological demands. Examples of model validation demonstrate their reliability. One of the main challenges in improvement of ion beam technologies is the customisation of the ion beam properties, e.g. the ion current density profile for specific demands. Methods of an ex-situ and in-situ beam profile control will be demonstrated. Examples for the use of ion beam technologies in space and on earth \textendash{} the RIT-10 rescue mission of ESA's satellite Artemis, the RIT-22 for BepiColombo mission and the deposition of multilayer stacks for EUVL (Extreme Ultra Violet Lithography) mask blank application are provided in order to illustrate the potential of plasma-based ion beam sources.},

Despite a similarity of the effective discharge parameters in both the {$\mu$}s and ns twin SDBD, erosion of the nickel coated electrodes caused by operation of the twin SDBD differs strongly. Only the formation of a moderate number of nickel oxide species is observed on the surface of the ns twin SDBD electrodes. In contrast, the nickel coated electrodes are locally melted and considerably higher densities of oxides are observed around the eroded areas of the {$\mu$}s twin SDBD, due to the filamentary nature of the discharge.},

Very good agreement between measurement and simulation is found. The main formation mechanisms for metastable helium atoms are identified and analyzed, including their pronounced spatio-temporal dynamics. Penning ionization through helium metastables is found to be significant for plasma sustainment, while it is revealed that helium metastables are not an important energy carrying species into the jet effluent and therefore will not play a direct role in remote surface treatments.},

The impacting velocity and critical velocity of particles depend on the powder properties and cold spray conditions. In the present study, the in-flight particle velocity of copper powder in low pressure cold spraying was measured using an imaging technique. The effects of particle size and particle morphology on in-flight particle velocity and deposition efficiency were investigated. The critical velocity of copper powder was estimated by combining the in-flight particle velocity and deposition efficiency. The effect of annealing of feedstock powder on deposition and critical velocity was also investigated. The results showed that the irregular shape particle presents higher in-flight velocity than the spherical shape particle under the same condition. For irregular shape particles, the in-flight velocity decreased from 390 to 282 m/s as the particle size increases from 20 to 60 mm. Critical velocities of about 425 m/s and more than 550 m/s were estimated for the feedstock copper powder with spherical and irregular shape morphology, respectively. For the irregular shape particles, the critical velocity decreased from more than 550 to 460 m/s after preheating at 390 \textdegree C for 1 h. It was also found that the larger size powder presents a lower critical velocity in this study.}

It is applied for various plasmas, e.g. barrier and corona discharges for industrial applications or geophysical plasmas occurring in the Earth's atmosphere. The method relies on the dependence of the intensity ratio R(E/N) of selected bands on the reduced electric field strength. Both experimental and theoretical approaches have been used to determine this dependence, yet there still is a rather large spread in the data available in literature. The primary aim of this work is to quantify the overall uncertainty of the theoretical R(E/N) dependence and identify the main sources of this uncertainty. As the first step we perform sensitivity analysis on a full N2/O2 plasma kinetics model to find a minimal set of processes that are influential for the R(E/N) dependence. It is found to be in agreement with simplified kinetic models generally used. Subsequently, we utilize Monte Carlo-based uncertainty quantification to provide a confidence band for the electric field obtained from the theoretical R(E/N) dependence. Finally, subsequent steps are proposed to significantly reduce the uncertainty of the method.},

Time resolved measurements of the positive ion flux in a hydrogen plasma, using a mass resolved ion energy analyser, reveal that a constant 2?eV mean ion energy persists for several hundred micro-seconds in the afterglow. The presence of a finite sheath potential is explained by super-elastic collisions between vibrationally excited hydrogen molecules and electrons in the afterglow, leading to an electron temperature of about 0.5?eV. Plasma density decay times measured using both the mass resolved energy analyser and a Langmuir probe are in good agreement. Vibrational temperatures measured using optical emission spectroscopy support the theory of electron heating through super-elastic collisions with vibrationally excited hydrogen molecules. Measurements are also supported by numerical simulations and modelling results.}

This is due to (1) the heating associated with the space-charge field only being effective in the plasma sheath, which is very close to the vessel inner wall. (2) The vessel temperature value at the external wall is taken as a boundary condition, as a result of which the space-charge field influence on gas heating is indirectly imposed on the model. The results of the collisional-radiative model take into account the influence of gas heating on the electron temperature and on the argon low-lying excited levels. Two different zones have been found. The first corresponds to low electron densities, in which the gas temperature remains constant, whereas in the second (high electron densities) the heating of the gas takes on great importance. These results compare well with experimental data.},

  abstract = {Using a helium ion hitting various metal surfaces as a model system, we describe a general quantum-kinetic approach for calculating ion-induced secondary electron emission spectra at impact energies where the emission is driven by the internal potential energy of the ion. It is based on an effective model of the Anderson-Newns-type for the subset of electronic states of the ion-surface system most strongly affected by the collision. Central to our approach is a pseudo-particle representation for the electronic configurations of the projectile which enables us, by combining it with two additional auxiliary bosons, to describe in a single Hamiltonian emission channels involving electronic configurations with different internal potential energies. It is thus possible to treat Auger neutralization of the ion on an equal footing with Auger de-excitation of temporarily formed radicals and/or negative ions. From the Dyson equations for the projectile propagators and an approximate evaluation of the self-energies, rate equations are obtained for the probabilities with which the projectile configurations occur and an electron is emitted in the course of the collision. Encouraging numerical results, especially for the helium-tungsten system, indicate the potential of our approach.},

  abstract = {Dust grains immersed into a low-temperature plasma are charged negatively because the electron attachment dominates other charging processes. However, increasing energy of impinging electrons leads to the increase of the yield of secondary emission. When this yield exceeds unity, the grain becomes charged positively. Previous laboratory experiments with electron beams have shown that the surface potential of large grains follows roughly an energy dependence of the secondary emission yield. It means that the grain potential reaches its maximum for hundreds of electronvolts of electron energy and then decreases. Model calculations reveal that the decrease of the grain potential with the electron energy can lead to the reversal of charge sign in a certain range of grain diameters. After this reversal, the grain is charged to the negative potential close to the beam energy. We use of this effect for investigations of electron field emission from nonconducting spheres (glass and melamine formaldehyde resin) with the diameter 4\textendash 11 \textbackslash mum for glass and 5 and 10 \textbackslash mum for resin. Single grains were trapped in a Paul trap and bombarded by the electron beam. The beam energy was changed in a range of 0.3\textendash 10 keV. The experimental results confirm the aforementioned expectations and an analysis of these results has shown that: 1) the effective work function for electron field emission from charged nonconducting materials (glass and melamine resin) could be as low as 2 eV, but it can be close to 5 eV as expected for insulating materials. The difference is connected with the charging history. 2) The effect of field dependent secondary emission limits the attainable negative potential.}

Charging processes of dust in space and their influence on the dust dynamics are analyzed in laboratory simulations of secondary emission, field ion and electron emissions, and dust sputtering. Single micrometre-sized grains and grain clusters are stored in a hyperbolic quadrupole field under ultra-high vacuum conditions for long time periods. The charge state of the grain and its evolution are recorded while the grain is exposed to ion or electron beams of various energies and fluxes. The influence of the secondary electron emission on the charge state is measured and compared with a computer model. Limitations on the grain charge by the field electron and ion emission are considered next. The measurements allow analyzing field emission from conductive and dielectric grains. The existence of long-lived surface states on insulating materials, which are probably responsible for the anomalous behavior of field electron emission and the low threshold of the field ion emission, is indicated. The observation of sputtering by energetic ions showing a surprising anisotropic erosion of a conductive grain is analyzed. The sputtering and the field ion emission are discussed as possible sources of the so-called pick-up ions.}

In the laboratory, only the beam experiments would fulfill these conditions; however, in the space, ions of these energies can be found even in the solar wind. It was suggested that the sputtering is one of the most important destruction processes of micrometer-sized dust grains, and on the other hand, it would be a source of heavy species in the interplanetary medium. We simulate the space environment by trapping the dust grains in an electrodynamic quadrupole trap and by influencing them by the ion beam with a variable energy up to 5 keV. The grains are charged to high surface potentials, and thus, a strong electric field near the surface can affect the sputtering rate. The finite size and the small curvature radius of grains play an important role in the quantification of sputtering efficiency. We propose a simple sputtering model for spherical grains and compare its predictions with measurements. An interpretation of the preliminary results obtained on gold microspheres bombarded by argon ions indicates that not only the grain mass but also the grain shape is changing in the course of our experiment. We suggest that similar effects can occur in the space if the dust is exposed to collimated ion beams.}

To reach the required implantation conditions, i.e. low He ion fluxes (1011\textendash 1014 ions.cm2.s\`A1) and kinetic energies below the W atom displacement threshold (about 500 eV for He+), an ICP source has been designed and connected to a diffusion chamber. Implantation conditions have been characterized by means of complementary diagnostics modified for measurements in this very low density helium plasma. It was shown that lowest ion fluxes could only be reached for the discharge working in capacitive mode either in a or c regime. Special attention was paid to control the energy gained by the ions by acceleration through the sheath at the direct current biased substrate. At very low helium pressure, in a regime, a broad ion energy distribution function was evidenced, whereas a peak centered on the potential difference between the plasma and the biased substrate was found at higher pressures in the c mode. Polycrystalline tungsten samples were exposed to the helium plasma in both regimes of the discharge and characterized by positron annihilation spectroscopy in order to detect the formed vacancy defects. It was found that W vacancies are able to be formed just by helium accumulation and that the same final implanted state is reached, whatever the operating mode of the capacitive discharge.},

The yields of electrons per ion, fast atom and photon vary greatly with particle energy and surface condition. Then models of electron, ion, fast atom, excited atom and photon transport and kinetics are fitted to electrical-breakdown and low-current, discharge-maintenance data to determine the contributions of various cathode-directed species to the secondary electron production. Our model explains measured breakdown and low-current discharge voltages for Ar over a very wide range of electric field to gas density ratios \$E/n\$ i.e. 15 Td to 100 kTd. We review corrections for nonequilibrium electron motion near the cathode that apply to our local-field model of these discharges. Analytic expressions for the cross sections and reaction coefficients used by this and related models are summarized.}

Extensive tables compare our entire database to the NRLMSISE-00, MSISE-90, and Jacchia-70 models for different altitude bands and levels of geomagnetic activity. We also explore scientific issues related to the new data sets in the NRLMSIS database. Especially noteworthy is the solar activity dependence of the Jacchia data, with which we study a large O+ contribution to the total mass density under the combination of summer, low solar activity, high latitude, and high altitude. Under these conditions, except at very low solar activity, the Jacchia data and the Jacchia-70 model indeed show a significantly higher total mass density than does MSISE-90. However, under the corresponding winter conditions, the MSIS-class models represent a noticeable improvement relative to Jacchia-70 over a wide range of F10.7.

For large antenna distances the shift of the main cone and the interference structure are found to be in agreement with the low-temperature approximation. On the contrary for short distances the measured interference pattern can only be described by the complete solution for the least damped root of the dispersion relation. The retrograde curvature of this branch is demonstrated. The determination of electron density and temperature from resonance cones can now be performed in an extended parameter range.}

The influence of the contamination layer is thoroughly analysed in the frame of a nonlinear equivalent circuit. When operating the probe in ramp mode, it is found that the distortion of the current-voltage characteristic is different for decreasing and increasing probe voltages. The resulting error of the electron temperature is determined for a range of capacitance (C) and resistance (R) values of the contamination layer. A method is described to determine the parameters R and C from the flight data. Further, a correction algorithm is discussed that allows the true probe characteristic to be retrieved from the measured distorted characteristic.}

Spontaneously excited dust density waves are observed when the dust cloud exceeds a minimum size. The waves are characterized by sickle-shaped wave fronts. No standing waves were found.

This paper summarizes recommended practices for the design, calibration, and operation of pendulum thrust stands, which are widely recognized as the best approach for measuring \textmu N- to mN-level thrust and \textmu Ns-level impulse bits. The fundamentals of pendulum thrust stand operation are reviewed, along with its implementation in hanging pendulum, inverted pendulum, and torsional balance configurations. Methods of calibration and recommendations for calibration processes are presented. Sources of error are identified and methods for data processing and uncertainty analysis are discussed. This review is intended to be the first step toward a recommended practices document to help the community produce high quality thrust measurements.},

  abstract = {An electric propulsion thrust stand capable of supporting testing of thrusters having a total mass of up to 125kg and producing thrust levels between 100 {$\mu$}N to 1N has been developed and tested. The design features a conventional hanging pendulum arm attached to a balance mechanism that converts horizontal deflections produced by the operating thruster into amplified vertical motion of a secondary arm. The level of amplification is changed through adjustment of the location of one of the pivot points linking the system. Response of the system depends on the relative magnitudes of the restoring moments applied by the displaced thruster mass and the twisting torsional pivots connecting the members of the balance mechanism. Displacement is measured using a noncontact, optical linear gap displacement transducer, and balance oscillatory motion is attenuated using a passive, eddy-current damper. The thrust stand employs an automated leveling and thermal control system. Pools of liquid gallium are used to deliver power to the thruster without using solid wire connections, which can exert undesirable time-varying forces on the balance. These systems serve to eliminate sources of "zero drift" that can occur as the stand thermally or mechanically shifts during the course of an experiment. An in situcalibration rig allows for steady-state calibration before, during, and after thruster operation. Thrust measurements were carried out on a cylindrical Hall thruster that produces millinewton-level thrust. The measurements were very repeatable, producing results that compare favorably with previously published performance data, but with considerably smaller uncertainty.},

Spectra and intensities of the discrete lines emitted by sputtered alkali atoms have been measured as a function of the beam mass, its energy, the target temperature and the distance from the surface. In particular, we have found that the radiation emitted by sputtered alkali atoms extends to surprisingly large distances from the electron bombarded surface of alkali halides. The results are discussed in terms of the relevant sputtering mechanisms responsible for alkali halide erosion. It is suggested that the atomic excitation of ion sputtered particles takes place at the surface in the final collision of the cascade, while most of the observed radiation in the case of electron bombardment originates in gas-phase collisions above the surface.}

The harnesses consisted of three different space-grade cable types: power cables, screened twisted pair data cables and radio frequency (RF) cables. They were alternately shielded by two different types of representative spacecraft structure walls. Ten hypervelocity impact (HVI) tests at 0\textdegree{} incidence have been performed with impact velocities ranging from 6.4 km/s to 7.7 km/s. Projectiles have been aluminium spheres with diameters ranging from 1.5 mm to 4.0 mm. During the tests, all cables were operated at their representative conditions and the disturbances, induced by the impacts, were measured. The malfunction observed could be related to two physical failure mechanisms: (1) short circuits caused by a conducting cloud of molten and evaporated aluminium and, for the data cables, (2) strands being bent by impacting fragments creating a short circuit between screen and signal cable. The influence of a more complex structure wall to the failure mechanism in (1) is shown. Malfunction was dependent on mechanical damage, but no clear correlation between severity of malfunction and mechanical damage could be established. The data cables were the most vulnerable cable, while the RF cables were the most robust. The disturbances recorded could pose a significant threat to connected electronic equipment. Examples of electrical performance are given.}

Cross sections for other atoms can be estimated by interpolating in terms of their ionization potentials. The results are in fair agreement with experiment. A similar calculation has been attempted for asymmetric nonresonant charge exchange processes. The approximations used are more restrictive in this calculation, the calculations being only semiquantitative in nature. The cross section of an asymmetric charge exchange process is determined in terms of the \$\textbackslash Delta E\$ of the reaction and the ``average'' ionization potential of the two atoms. The results are qualitatively in agreement with experiment. A very brief discussion of approaches for extrapolating data to lower velocities, where the rectilinear orbit impact parameter method is not applicable, is given.}

More limited measurements were performed in C2H4 and SF6. Great care was taken to assure complete collection of electron and ion currents, and the absence of spurious instrumental errors. A new method was devised for obtaining absolute cross sections of gases relative to H2, and a McLeod gauge was used to obtain the absolute cross section in H2. The cross sections in NO and O2 could not be obtained by this method, and an approximate correction to direct McLeod-gauge readings was used for these gases. It is believed that the results are as accurate as is possible with the present method. It is difficult to explain the differences found between cross sections measured by various investigators. McLeod-gauge errors appear to account for most of the difference in absolute magnitude.}

The challenge of very high thermal load was solved by using an advanced time-resolved measuring and evaluation technique. The combination with a controlled movement of the jets allowed to obtain insightful radial profiles. The energy flux to the substrate changes linearly to the electrical input power. When adding diatomic gases (H2/N2) to the gas mixture the energy flux increases significantly, suggesting a more efficient energy transport. For increasing the axial distance, the energy flux shows a quadratic reduction. The obtained radial profiles are exemplarily utilized to show the inhomogeneous effect of powder injection on the energy flux distribution.},

In this paper, we demonstrate how to eliminate ambient species influence on effluent chemistry by ensheathing the effluent. With a designed shielding gas composition, we control the species flowing into the jet effluent and thus control the effluent chemistry. The proposed approach can be applied to the majority of possible jet plasma sources. Flow simulations as well as VUV-absorption spectroscopy measurements prove the gas curtain to be effective in shielding the jet gas from ambient species and show that a control of reactive species within the jet effluent is possible. On the example of plasma treatment of a NaCl solution, we demonstrate that, by adjusting the shielding gas composition, the generation of nitrite and nitrate in the solution can be finely controlled.},

Especially, where the plasmainduced effects are extremely sensitive to humidity, such as in the field of plasma medicine, an understanding of the influence of ambient species diffusion on plasma chemistry and on reactive component composition is crucial. In this paper, we investigate the influence of ambient humidity versus feed gas humidity on the production of reactive components by atmospheric pressure plasma jets. By the use of a shielding gas curtain, we control the surrounding atmosphere around the active effluent region of the investigated argon RF-plasma jet (kinpen) and control the gas humidity of the ambient gas. By quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy and by Fourier transformed infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy, the effect of diffusing surrounding molecular species on the chemistry of the long-living reactive oxygen species is investigated. Mechanisms of H2O2 and O3 production are studied. In this paper, we have quantified the influence that ambient species, namely, water molecules, have on the reactive species' generation in the gas phase. It is shown that the effect of ambient humidity is important for the long-living species production, feed gas humidity, however, has the much stronger effect. Finally, with the focus of applications in plasma medicine, the cell viability of human skin cells (HaCaT keratinocytes) as a function of feed gas and ambient gas humidity is compared.},

Accounting for the correct boundary conditions at the sheath edge, convenient analytical approximations are constructed both in the fluid and in the kinetic approach. The fluid solution is universal and does not depend on the special plasma properties. In the kinetic analysis, in contrast, different plasma models must be distinguished because the space charge formation depends on the ion velocity distribution at the sheath edge. The differences are significant in particular at low sheath potentials. Explicit formulae are given for the Tonks-Langmuir model and for the charge exchange model. All approximations represent the sheath potential profiles with surprising accuracy.}

Bohm's criterion expresses a necessary condition for the formation of a stationary sheath in front of a negative absorbing wall. The basic features of the plasma-sheath transition and their relation to the Bohm criterion are discussed and illustrated from a simple cold-ion fluid model. A rigorous kinetic analysis of the vicinity of the sheath edge allows one to generalize Bohm's criterion accounting not only for arbitrary ion and electron distributions, but also for general boundary conditions at the wall. It is shown that the generalized sheath condition is (apart from special exceptions) marginally fulfilled and related to a sheath edge field singularity. Due to this singularity, smooth matching of the presheath and sheath solutions requires an additional transition layer. Previous investigations concerning particular problems of the plasma-sheath transition are reviewed in the light of the general relations.},

The surfaces in plasma may be the interior walls of confinement devices or inserted probes. Fluid and kinetic models are presented in some detail, and particle-in-cell models are discussed briefly. The numerical methods find the spatial profile of the potential, the particle densities near the surfaces and the current to the surfaces. Maxwellian electrons and cold ions are assumed at the outset and subsequently the models are expanded to encompass (1) multiple electron populations, (2) multiple ion species, (3) finite ion temperature, (4) surfaces that emit electrons such as heated cathodes or emissive probes and (5) surfaces that emit plasma as in the Q-machine. These complications may produce nonmonotonic sheaths in which the first derivative of the potential changes sign or double layers in which the second derivative changes sign. The effect of charge-exchange collisions on ion losses to the wall and on ion current to probes is discussed, but models with collisions of electron are omitted. Some recent advances are discussed, including experiments that measure the ion distribution function in sheaths using laser-induced fluorescence, experiments and numerical models on sheaths with multiple ion species and computational models of sheaths surrounding objects in flowing plasma.},

The atomic scattering is governed by the Moli\'ere potential. Impact-parameter-dependent inelastic losses are included using Firsov's theory. Thermal vibrations of the target atoms and crystal surfaces may be included. Permanent displacement of lattice atoms may be based on either an energy-threshold criterion or a Frenkel-pair-separation criterion. An extensive series of calculations has been made for cascades in the simple metals Cu, Fe, and Au, to test the effects on the results of many of the model parameters. When a displacement-threshold energy is used, the number of Frenkel pairs is found to be a linear function of that part of the primary recoil energy which remains as the kinetic energy of atoms. This result is independent of target temperature, of the presence or absence of inelastic energy losses, and of various details of the model. In contrast, when a separation criterion is used, the number of defects increases less rapidly than linearly. This effect is caused by increased recombination in the highly disturbed tracks of the energetic recoils. Agreement between theoretical and experimental estimates of the radiation damage produced by neutron irradiation of Cu is substantially improved in the latter model.}

Among the different available processes, gas phase nanoparticle (cluster) formation techniques are of great interest for both large scale production and fundamental studies. Here, a plasma-gasaggregation cluster source (GAS) apparatus with 6 in. diameter silicon sputter target has been designed and constructed. The selection of a 6 in. target represents a step towards scale up of the GAS to large-area deposition desired by industrial applications. Silicon clusters with average diameter of ca. 1\textendash 2 nm were prepared without a size-selective filtering system. From experiment and simulation, the slip flow regime of the gas in the aggregation region suggests that in addition to the sputtering conditions, the wall morphology also affects the growth process of silicon clusters. Controlling these factors influences the growth of the clusters (nanoparticles) leading to the desired size required for given properties.},

  abstract = {The amount of current carried by an electric discharge in its early stages of growth is strongly dependent on its geometrical shape. Discharges with a large number of branches, each funnelling current to a common stem, tend to carry more current than those with fewer branches. The fractal character of typical discharges was simulated using stochastic models based on solutions of the Laplace equation. Extension of these models requires the use of electron distribution functions to describe the behavior of electrons in the undisturbed medium ahead of the discharge. These electrons, interacting with the electric field, determine the propagation of branches in the discharge and the way in which further branching occurs. The first phase in the extension of the referenced models , the calculation of simple electron distribution functions in an air/electric field medium, is discussed. Two techniques are investigated: (1) the solution of the Boltzmann equation in homogeneous, steady state environments, and (2) the use of Monte Carlo simulations. Distribution functions calculated from both techniques are illustrated. Advantages and disadvantages of each technique are discussed.},

This geometry makes the device sensitive to the momentum of sputtered target atoms and reflected beam particles, but insensitive for the momentum of the impinging particles itself. Exemplary measurements with argon ions in the energy range from 0.5 keV to 1.5 keV impinging onto copper targets at an incidence angle of 56\textdegree{} are presented.

Tailor-made modification of polymers is essential in order to make these processes more efficient and to cover the industrial demands. The so far used polymer materials show weak performance regarding the mechanical stability of processed parts. To overcome this limitation, a new route to functionalize the surface of commercially available polymer particles (PA12; PE-HD; PP) using an atmospheric plasma jet in combination with a fluidized bed reactor has been investigated. Consequently, an improvement of adhesion and wettability [2] of the polymer surface without restraining the bulk properties of the powder is achieved. The atmospheric plasma jet process can provide reactive species at moderate temperatures which are suitable for polymer material. The functionalization of the polymer powders improves the quality of the devices build in a SLS-process.},

Our model includes over 50 species and 600 elementary reactions and consists of two, coupled well-mixed regions: a discharge layer with both charged and neutral species and an afterglow region consisting only of neutral species. Multiple time steps employed in our model enable capturing rapid dynamic behaviour in the discharge layer as well as the relatively slow diffusion and reaction in the afterglow. A short duration, high electric field is assumed to be excited at 10 kHz in the discharge region with power density maintained at 0.05 W cm-2. Among the predicted dominant species in the afterglow are O3, N2O5, N2O, HNO3, H2, NO3, H2O2, HNO2 and NO2. The results are in qualitative agreement with Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy. Our simulation results show that density of those reactive species continues to evolve significantly in time, even after {$\sim$}15 min of SMD exposure. This result suggests that SMD treatments on the order of minutes or less may involve significant neutral species concentration and flux transients, potentially affecting interpretation of results.},

Since dust charge is a function of a number of plasma parameters, and the dust charge adjusts itself to changes in plasma conditions instantaneously, dust particles may be used as an ideal diagnostic tool. A major advantage of such a diagnostic approach is its simplicity as the only measurement of a position of a dust particle or its motion after a perturbation is necessary. This technique only requires access to a discharge chamber, dust particles, a laser to illuminate them and a camera to capture the motion of the dust. The dependences of the sheath profiles on the discharge pressure and power have been determined. The radial potential profiles in a cylindrically-symmetrical capacitively-coupled rf discharge and in an IEC plasma were obtained. The direction of the ion flux in the radial IEC discharge was found.}

The neutral-beam source consists of an inductively coupled plasma(ICP)source and parallel top and bottom carbon plates. The bottom carbon plate has numerous apertures for extracting neutral beams from the plasma. When a direct current (dc) bias is applied to the top and bottom plates, the generated positive or negative ions are accelerated toward the bottom plate. Most of them are then efficiently converted into neutral atoms, either by neutralization in charge-transfer collisions with gas molecules during ion transport and with the aperture sidewalls in the bottom plate, or by recombination with low-energy electrons near the end of the bottom plate. We found that negative ions are more efficiently converted into neutral atoms than positive ions. The neutralization efficiency of negative ions was almost 100\%, and the maximum neutral flux density was equivalent to 4.0 mA/cm2. A neutral beam can thus be efficiently produced from the ICPsource and apertures in our new neutral-beam source.},

  abstract = {A pulsed emissive probe technique is presented for measuring the plasma potential of pulsed plasma discharges. The technique provides time-resolved data and features minimal disturbance of the plasma achieved by alternating probe heating with the generation of plasma. Time resolution of about 20 ns is demonstrated for high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS) plasma of niobium in argon. Spatial resolution of about 1 mm is achieved by using a miniature tungsten filament mounted on a precision translational stage. Repeated measurements for the same discharge conditions show that the standard deviation of the measurements is about 1\textendash 2 V, corresponding to 4\%\textendash 8\% of the maximum plasma potential relative to ground. The principle is demonstrated for measurements at a distance of 30 mm from the target, for different radial positions, at an argon pressure of 0.3 Pa, a cathode voltage of -420 V, and a discharge current of about 60 A in the steady-state phase of the HIPIMS pulse.},

The operations of differentiation and filtering are especially important both as an end in themselves, and as a prelude to further treatment of the data. Numerical counterparts of analog devices that perform these operations, such as RC filters, are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be used without additional computational complexity and with considerable improvement in the informotion obtained. The least squares calculations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectroscopic applications. The computer programs required are relatively simple. Two examples are presented as subroutines in the FORTRAN language.}

The results demonstrate that the plasma filaments forming an inclination angle {$\alpha$} with the axial gas velocity uz are forced to a transversal movement with the velocity , which is oriented in the inclination direction. Variations of in the model reveal that the observed dynamics minimizes the energy loss due to convective heat transfer by the gas flow.

Self-consistent numerical solutions are obtained for equations describing carrier transport, carrier generation, and space-charge balance. The solutions describe the evolution in time of the diode and its associated resonant circuit. Detailed solutions are presented of the hole and electron concentrations, electric field, and terminal current and voltage at various points in time during a cycle of oscillation. Large-signal values of the diode's negative conductance, susceptance, average voltage, and power-generating efficiency are presented as a function of oscillation amplitude for a fixed average current density.

These measurements show that the sheath width as well as the levitation height of the microparticles correlates with the dc self-bias as a function of the phase between the applied voltage harmonics. By a second method, profiles of the force acting on an optically trapped microparticle in an optical tweezer in the sheath were measured. On the basis of these force profiles, the strength of the electric field force as a function of pressure and the dependency on the distance of the probe to the rf electrode as well as the extent of the sheath are determined in both a single- and a dual-frequency discharge. From the results, it can be deduced that the sheath thickness and the electric field force in a dual-frequency discharge are influenced by both excitation frequencies and, thus, differ from a single-frequency discharge.}

The jet is operated with a shielding gas device that produces a gas curtain of defined composition around the plasma plume. The shielding gas composition is varied from pure to pure . The density of metastable argon in the plasma plume was quantified using laser atom absorption spectroscopy. The density of long-living reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), namely , , , , and , was quantified in the downstream region of the jet in a multipass cell using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The jet produces a turbulent flow field and features guided streamers propagating at several that follow the chaotic argon flow pattern, yielding a plasma plume with steep spatial gradients and a time dependence on the scale while the downstream chemistry unfolds within several seconds. The fast and highly localized electron impact reactions in the guided streamer head and the slower gas phase reactions of neutrals occurring in the plasma plume and experimental apparatus are therefore represented in two separate kinetic models. The first electron impact reaction kinetics model is correlated to the LAAS measurements and shows that in the guided streamer head primary reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are dominantly generated from . The second neutral species plug-flow model hence uses an source term as sole energy input and yields good agreement with the RONS measured by FTIR spectroscopy.},

Combined with computational fluid dynamics simulations, the method not only yields the temporally averaged ambient air density and temperature in the effluent of the fully turbulent jet, but also allows for an estimation of the calorimetric power deposited by the plasma. The change of the refractive index due to mixing of argon and air is in the same range as caused by the temperature increase of less than 35 K in the effluent of the plasma jet. The Schlieren contrast therefore needs to be corrected for the contribution from ambient air diffusion. The Schlieren system can be calibrated accurately using the signal obtained from the argon flow when the plasma is turned off. The temperature measured in this way is compared to the value obtained using a fibre-optics temperature probe and shows excellent agreement. By fitting a heat source in a fluid dynamics simulation to match the measured temperature field, the calorimetric power deposited by the plasma jet can be estimated as 1.1 W.},

The method is derived for a nine-point difference scheme and can readily be applied to the more conventional five-point scheme simply through the use of the five-point scheme coefficients. The method is demonstrated by application to several examples and a comparison is made between the performance of the modified procedure and that of the strongly implicit procedure, the alternating direction implicit method, and successive over-relaxation. In all cases examined the modified strongly implicit procedure offers superior results when the number of iterations required for convergence or the computational cost required for convergence is used as the measure of performance. The method is also less sensitive to control volume aspect ratio, relaxation parameters, and mesh subdivision than other available procedures. Savings in computational cost for a converged solution range from a factor of two to a factor of four over the strongly implicit procedure. It is felt that the development of this procedure offers a significant advance in the state of the art of solving the finite-difference equations that are used to describe field problems.}

Protonated water cluster ions are detected indicating that water impurity has to be considered carefully. The combination of the presence of water cluster ions and O2 molecules at the surface leads to the strongest effect. Additionally, the interaction of plasma-generated VUV photons with the effluent of the He/O2 plasma, but not with ground state O2, leads to faster inactivation of bacteria, most probably due to enhanced formation of O and O3.},

Instead of discrete equilibria we find a type of ground state consisting of infinitely many orientations. This continuum of energetically degenerate states represents a yet unknown form of magnetic frustration. The corresponding dipole rotations in the flat potential valley of this Goldstone mode enable the construction of frictionless magnetic couplings. Using computer-assisted algebraic geometry methods, we moreover completely enumerate all equilibrium configurations. The seemingly simple cubic system allows for exactly 9536 unstable discrete equilibria falling into 183 distinct energy families.}

We quantify ground-state densities of key species, atomic oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H), produced from admixtures of water vapour (up to 0.5\%) to the helium feed gas in a radio-frequency-driven plasma at atmospheric pressure. Absolute density measurements, using two-photon absorption laser induced fluorescence, require accurate effective excited state lifetimes. For atmospheric pressure plasmas, picosecond resolution is needed due to the rapid collisional de-excitation of excited states. These absolute O and H density measurements, at the nozzle of the plasma jet, are used to benchmark a plug-flow, 0D chemical kinetics model, for varying humidity content, to further investigate the main formation pathways of O and H. It is found that impurities can play a crucial role for the production of O at small molecular admixtures. Hence, for controllable reactive species production, purposely admixed molecules to the feed gas is recommended, as opposed to relying on ambient molecules. The controlled humidity content was also identified as an effective tailoring mechanism for the O/H ratio.}

  abstract = {Measurements of ion flux-energy distribution functions at the high sheath potential of the driven electrode in a classical low-pressure asymmetric capacitively coupled plasma are technically difficult as the diagnostic device needs to float with the applied radio frequency voltage. Otherwise, the ion sampling is disturbed by the varying electric field between the grounded device and the driven electrode. To circumvent such distortions, a low-pressure plasma chamber with inverted electrode geometry, where the larger electrode is driven and the smaller electrode is grounded, has been constructed and characterized. Measurements of the ion flux-energy distribution functions with an energy-selective mass spectrometer at the high sheath potential of the grounded electrode are presented for a variety of conditions and ions. The potential for suppressing low-energy ions from resonant charge transfer collisions in the sheath by the dilution of the working gas is demonstrated. Additionally, the setup is supplemented by an inductively coupled plasma that controls the plasma density and consequently the ion flux to the substrate while the radio frequency bias controls the ion energy. At high ion energies, metal ions are detected as a consequence of the ionization of sputtered electrode material. The proposed setup opens a way to study precisely the effects of ion treatment for a variety of substrates such as catalysts, polymers, or thin films.},

The injection causes plasma instability, which becomes visible as an oscillation of the emission intensity. The frequency of this oscillation can be uniquely correlated to the particle diameter. Consequently, the measurement of the oscillation frequency represents a method to determine particle diameters in situ. The oscillation corresponds to the rotation of a localized plasmoid and a particle cloud around the symmetry axis of the reactor. It is assumed that this rotation is driven by the ion wind crossing the interface between the plasmoid and the particle cloud.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            We present a new method for the determination of surface coefficients, more specifically the effective ion-induced secondary electron yield,               {$\gamma$}               eff               , and the effective elastic electron reflection coefficient,               r               eff               , by means of a synergistic combination of energy-selective mass spectrometry measurements and numerical particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collisions simulations of the ion flux-energy distribution function (IEDF) in a symmetric capacitively coupled plasma (CCP). In particular, we analyze the bimodal peak structure of the IEDF, which is caused by ions crossing the sheath without collisions. The position and width of this structure on the energy scale are defined by the time-averaged sheath potential and the ion transit time through the sheath, respectively. We find that both characteristics are differently influenced by               {$\gamma$}               eff               and               r               eff               . The ion-induced secondary electrons are accelerated in the large sheath potential and mainly influence the plasma density, sheath width and, consequently, the ion transit time and in this way the bimodal peak separation. Electron reflection from the electrodes acts mainly at times of sheath collapse, where low energy electrons can reach the surfaces. Their contribution to the plasma density increase is small, however, their longer residence time in the vicinity of the electrodes modifies the space charge density and the potential gradient. Additionally, the charge balance at the electrode requires an incident electron flux that is correlated to the flux of emitted ion induced secondary electrons and reflected electrons, which is realized by a change of the electron repelling sheath voltage. As a consequence, the electron reflection coefficient mainly influences the sheath potential and, hence, the position of the bimodal peak structure. These effects allow the simultaneous               in situ               determination of both surface parameters. The parameter values determined for stainless steel and Al               2               O               3               surfaces are in good agreement with literature data.

Traditional sources include transferred arcs, plasma torches, corona discharges, and dielectric barrier discharges. In arcs and torches, the electron and neutral temperatures exceed 3000/spl deg/C and the densities of charge species range from 10/sup 16/-10/sup 19/ cm/sup -3/. Due to the high gas temperature, these plasmas are used primarily in metallurgy. Corona and dielectric barrier discharges produce nonequilibrium plasmas with gas temperatures between 50-400/spl deg/C and densities of charged species typical of weakly ionized gases. However, since these discharges are nonuniform, their use in materials processing is limited. Recently, an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet has been developed, which exhibits many characteristics of a conventional, low-pressure glow discharge. In the jet, the gas temperature ranges from 25-200/spl deg/C, charged-particle densities are 10/sup 11/-10/sup 12/ cm/sup -3/, and reactive species are present in high concentrations, i.e., 10-100 ppm. Since this source may be scaled to treat large areas, it could be used in applications which have been restricted to vacuum. In this paper, the physics and chemistry of the plasma jet and other atmospheric-pressure sources are reviewed.},

  abstract = {In orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometers (oa-TOFMSs), where ion velocity in the axis of the ion source is preserved, the ions approach grids at an angle not equal to 90[degree sign]. In this situation ions are expected to be dispersed more than in the case of the normal approach. This may be attributed primarily to the effect of grid wires that are not parallel with the source axis. The dispersion leads to a broadening of the flight-time distribution for ions of a given mass-to-charge ratio and hence it degrades mass resolving power. A novel 20 kV matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI) oa-TOFMS instrument has been used in this study to investigate grid dispersion. The results show that the dispersions that ions experience as they pass through grids/meshes that divide regions of different electric field strength have a significant effect on the resolving power when the majority of the wires are not aligned with the source. Numerical simulations of ion motion point to an advantage in using ideal parallel wire grids with line densities in excess of one hundred lines per centimeter, orientated with the ion source axis. The orientation of parallel wire grids has previously been predicted to significantly affect resolving power in oa-TOF instruments. This article presents the first experimental data to demonstrate the effect. Parallel wire grids of such high line densities are impractical to construct and support so a grid design that approximates parallel wires has been lithographically mastered for electroforming 70\% transmission grids with 120 lines per centimeter in one direction and 12 lines per centimeter at right angles to this direction. A resolution loss of 40\% (from a resolution of m/[Delta]m = 8000 at full width at half maximum) was observed when a three-grid orthogonal accelerator constructed with this material was rotated through 90[degree sign] from the predicted ideal orientation. The observed linewidths were in reasonable agreement with those predicted by ion trajectory calculations.},

Experimental results on radiometric forces on a 0.11 m diameter circular vane are obtained on a nano-Newton thrust stand in a 3 m long vacuum chamber for pressures ranging from approximately 0.01 to 1 Pa. The vane was heated to 419 K on the hot side and 396 K on the cold side. The numerical modeling is conducted using a combined ellipsoidal statistical Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook/direct simulation Monte Carlo approach that allows accurate and time efficient analysis of radiometric forces on a vane in large vacuum chambers filled with rarefied gas. Accommodation coefficients for the Maxwellmodel are estimated for argon, xenon, and helium on a machined aluminumsurface, and found to be 0.81, 0.86, and 0.53, respectively.},

Neutral beams are generally produced by electrostatically accelerating ions, which are neutralised before injection into the magnetised plasma. At the particle energy required for the most advanced thermonuclear devices and particularly for ITER, neutralisation of positive ions is very inefficient so that negative ions are used. The present paper is devoted to the description of the phenomena occurring when a high-power multi-ampere negative ion beam travels from the beam source towards the plasma. Simulation of the trajectory of the beam and of its features requires various numerical codes, which must take into account all relevant phenomena. The leitmotiv is represented by the interaction of the beam with the background gas. The main outcome is the partial neutralisation of the beam particles, but ionisation of the background gas also occurs, with several physical and technological consequences. Diagnostic methods capable of investigating the beam properties and of assessing the relevance of the various phenomena will be discussed. Examples will be given regarding the measurements collected in the small flexible NIO1 source and regarding the expected results of the prototype of the neutral beam injectors for ITER. The tight connection between measurements and simulations in view of the operation of the beam is highlighted.},

Two factors that may impact on Ez are discussed: mass ratio and the correction factor of electronic stopping ?{$\Psi$}?. Putting {$\Psi$} into the periodic table, we found that the values of J in the same congeners are similar and have the trend of ?W? shape. The row number (n) and column number (m) of the elements in the periodic table are used to fit the ?W? shape. The parabolic model is used to approximate the sputtering yield when E {$<$} Ez. Finally, the sputtering yield and the energy distributions of some common elements are used to verify the calculation method of Ez. The results show that the obtained formula can be applied to the situation of low energy heavy ion sputtering and to supplement Zhang's model.},

Recurrence of disease and emerging resistance of Trichophyton rubrum to synthetic antifungals are the main problems in control of dermatophytosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) on T. rubrum growth, ergosterol biosynthesis and keratinase activity. Methods: A CAP system, comprised of helium 98\% e oxygen 2\% (He/O2), was used. Trichophyton rubrum conidia suspensions were treated with CAP in time periods of 90, 120, 150 and 180 s in 96-well microplates. Fungal growth was evaluated by counting the colony forming unit (CFU). Fungal dry weight, ergosterol biosynthesis and keratinase activity were evaluated in CAP-treated T. rubrum and untreated controls. Results: T. rubrum growth was significantly inhibited by 62\%e91\%. CAP strongly suppressed fungal ergosterol biosynthesis by 27\%e54\%. The keratinase activity was increased by 7.30\%e21.88\% up to 120 s CAP exposure. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated for the first time that CAP inhibits T. rubrum growth, suppresses ergosterol biosynthesis and increases moderately keratinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, CAP exposure could be a potentially useful method for treatment of clinical cases of human and animal dermatophytoses.},

Typical fluid theory of a planar sheath with emitted electrons assumes that the plasma electrons follow the Boltzmann relation and the emitted electrons are emitted with zero energy and predicts a potential drop of 1.03Te/e across the sheath in the floating condition. By considering the modified velocity distribution function caused by plasma electrons lost to the wall and the half-Maxwellian distribution of the emitted electrons, it is shown that ratio of plasma electron temperature to emitted electron temperature significantly affects the sheath potential when the plasma electron temperature is within an order of magnitude of the emitted electron temperature. When the plasma electron temperature equals the emitted electron temperature the emissive sheath potential goes to zero. One dimensional particle-in-cell simulations corroborate the predictions made by this theory. The effects of the addition of a monoenergetic electron beam to the Maxwellian plasma electrons were explored, showing that the emissive sheath potential is close to the beam energy only when the emitted electron flux is less than the beam flux.}

An enrichment factor at low fluences of (M/Mj)\^2m, with Mj the isotopic mass and M its mean, as found previously, is reconfirmed, and its range of validity extended beyond the asymptotic limit of high ion energy. The results are discussed in relation to existing theoretical treatments and experimental data; except at very low bombarding ion energies, the agreement with experiment, is very satisfactory. Integral equations governing atomic collision cascades for polyatomic media are shown to have very simple solutions in case of small relative differences in mass and charge number. Conceptual and practical difficulties are discussed of a sputter emission model in which only atoms from the uppermost surface layer contribute to the sputter flux. It is suggested that large isotope enrichment effects observed at low ion energy are caused by recoil implantation.}

  abstract = {Sputtering of a target by energetic ions or recoil atoms is assumed to result from cascades of atomic collisions. The sputtering yield is calculated under the assumption of random slowing down in an infinite medium. An integrodifferential equation for the yield is developed from the general Boltzmann transport equation. Input quantities are the cross sections for ion-target and target-target collisions, and atomic binding energies. Solutions of the integral equation are given that are asymptotically exact in the limit of high ion energy as compared to atomic binding energies. Two main stages of the collision cascade have to be distinguished: first, the slowing down of the primary ion and all recoiling atoms that have comparable energies \textendash{} these particles determine the spatial extent of the cascade; second, the creation and slowing down of low-energy recoils that constitute the major part of all atoms set in motion. The separation between the two stages is essentially complete in the limit of high ion energy, as far as the calculation of the sputtering yield is concerned. High-energy collisions are characterized by Thomas-Fermi-type cross sections, while a Born-Mayer-type cross section is applied in the low-energy region. Electronic stopping is included when necessary. The separation of the cascade into two distinct stages has the consequence that two characteristic depths are important for the qualitative understanding of the sputtering process. First, the scattering events that eventually lead to sputtering take place within a certain layer near the surface, the thickness of which depends on ion mass and energy and on ion-target geometry. In the elastic collision region, this thickness is a sizable fraction of the ion range. Second, the majority of sputtered particles originate from a very thin surface layer ( 5 A), because small energies dominate. The general sputtering-yield formula is applied to specific situations that are of interest for comparison with experiment. These include backsputtering of thick targets by ion beams at perpendicular and oblique incidence and ion energies above 100 eV, transmission sputtering of thin foils, sputtering by recoil atoms from {$\alpha$}-active atoms distributed homogeneously or inhomogeneously in a thick target, sputtering of fissionable specimens by fission fragments, and sputtering of specimens that are irradiated in the core of a reactor or bombarded with a neutron beam. There is good agreement with experimental results on polycrystalline targets within the estimated accuracy of the data and the input parameters entering the theory. There is no need for adjustable parameters in the usual sense, but specific experimental setups are discussed that allow independent checks or accurate determination of some input quantities.}

Beam properties of both standard electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) emitters and arrays of custom made micro-fabricated emitters have been determined. By varying the geometries of the micro-fabricated emitters two basic modes of thruster operation have been identified a high Isp with lower thrust density and a lower Isp with higher thrust density. The versatility of this system allows for a thruster design that has a thrust range spanning two orders of magnitude from 5 to 500{$\mu$}N with highly competitive power requirements 0.05W/{$\mu$}N. The proposed thruster system is designed to meet the needs of future formation flying missions.}

Several solutions of the organic solvents ethylene and triethylene glycols doped with sodium iodide to give varying conductivities in the range of 0.0025-0.23?S/m have been sprayed. It was established for the first time that solution conductivity has no appreciable effect on the sensitivity of flow rate to applied voltage in the cone-jet mode of electrospray. However, it appears that even when the hydraulic resistance is taken into account, the sensitivity of flow rate as controlled by the applied voltage is additionally related to the emitter exit geometry. These findings are of particular importance to both spacecraft propulsion and electrospray mass spectrometry technologies and suggest careful emitter geometry design considerations will lead to greater control over electrospray properties.}

This volumetric flow rate voltage sensitivity holds particular significance for potential colloid electrospray propulsion systems, which operate at or near minimum flow rate conditions.

The ground sheath voltage which accelerates the ions was also determined using capacitive probe measurements and Langmuir probe data. Together, the measurements provide a complete characterization of ion dynamics in the sheath, allowing ion transit time effects to be distinguished from sheath impedance effects. Models are presented which describe both effects and explain why they are observed in the same range of rf bias frequency.}

Understanding the microphysics of individual grains and their interaction with the surrounding environment is a key to properly model various conditions and interpret existing data. The theory and models of individual dust grains are well developed for environments that vary from dense planetary atmospheres to dusty plasmas to diffuse environments such as interplanetary space. However, experimental investigations of individual dust grains in equilibrium are less common, perhaps due to the difficulty of these experiments. Laboratory measurements of dust grains have primarily measured ensemble properties or transient properties of single grains. A technique developed in the 1950's for ion spectroscopy, generally referred to as a quadrupole trap has recently been employed as an electrodynamic balance to investigate single micron-sized dust grains and for atmospheric aerosol research. A description of the theoretical basis and the experimental setup of the electrodynamic balance being developed in our laboratory are given. This laboratory technique lends itself to many applications that relate to planetary atmospheres, heliospheric environments, pre-stellar and pre-planetary conditions, and industrial settings. We present results from some recent experiments carried out to investigate the equilibrium potential of dust grains exposed to far ultraviolet light or to an electron beam. Some future experiments using an electrodynamic balance to investigate the optical characteristics, and condensation process involving dust grains in various astrophysical environments are discussed.}

Furthermore, the velocity directions in the plume remain relatively unchanged for the cusped and direct magnetic field configuration in both overrun and nonoverrun modes. Previously reported plume narrowing in the overrun mode was confirmed and found to be due to the shift of the acceleration and ionization regions toward the anode. The electric field inferred from the LIF measurements allowed calculation of the electron \$E \textbackslash times B\$ drift. Close to the centerline of the thruster, electrons drift azimuthally with velocity decreasing away from the centerline, thus creating shear. This shear can be a source of plasma instabilities and influence electron transport.

RF sources represent an interesting alternative to the conventional arc discharge sources. Due to the absence of hot filaments they exhibit an inherent simplicity both in mechanical and electrical aspects and consequently offer advantages in terms of cost savings, gain in availability and reliability and reduced maintenance. This renders the RF plasma source attractive for any long pulse ({$>$} 10 sec) NBI system and in particular for the ITER NBI system. The latter, however, requires that the RF plasma source is also capable of delivering negative rather than positive hydrogen ions. In the first part of the paper the types, characteristics and operation experience of RF plasma sources for positive ions in operation are described. The second part is devoted to the development for ITER NBI: The basic requirements, physics and technology issues and the present status are discussed.}

The rotatable sputter targets are centrally mounted in front of the ion source and allow a variation of the angle of incidence. The measurement surface of the force probe is arranged laterally beside the sputter target; it collects the particles released perpendicularly to the beam direction. Sputter targets of silver, copper, aluminum, titanium, and carbon are studied. The measurements are compared with a model that traces the trajectories of the argon ions and the sputtered target atoms between the ion source, the sputter target, and the force probe. The sputtering is calculated with the popular SRIM code based on binary collision cascades. The measured forces are found to be in general greater than the simulated forces. The dependence on the angle of incidence is similar in case of the elements heavier than the ions. In case of the lighter elements, only the simulation exhibits a pronounced maximum at angles between 65\textdegree{} and 70\textdegree.},

Impact ionization is used to determine the speed (1 \textendash{} 100 km/s) and the mass (1x10-15 \textendash{} 1x10-9g) of impinging particles. furthermore, the electric charge (1x10-15 \textendash{} 1x10-12C) of the particles can be measured via the induction principle, whilst an integrated time-of-flight mass spectrometer will analyze the chemical composition of the dust. In order to achieve sufficient sensitivity for dust fluxes as low as 1 particle/month, the sensor has a large sensitive area of 0.1 m2. This paper will describe the measurement signals of the engineering model of the CDA and their interpretation.}

  abstract = {Possible global distributions of solar-wind-implanted elements in the lunar regolith are considered. Arguments are given that concentrations of such elements are controlled by the rate of their desorption from the implanted layers on the regolith particles. This is confirmed by a large difference in concentration ratios of solar-wind-implanted elements in the regolith and the solar wind. Desorption rate of the implanted atoms is proportional to \$\textbackslash exp(-U/kT)\$, where k is Boltzmann constant and U is activation energy, so it sharply decreases with decreasing temperature. This favors accumulation of the implanted elements in polar regions of the Moon. The implanted layers on the regolith particles damaged by radiation contain a variety of atomic configurations, hence a wide range of trapping energies (characterized by the activation energy U) should be expected for the implanted atoms. High values of U ({$>$} 1 eV) typical of vacancies and broken chemical bonds account for high (by many orders greater than the equilibrium solubility) concentrations of the implanted gases found in the regolith of the equatorial regions. Lower trapping energies U are not effective at low latitudes, but contribute to long trapping of the implanted gases in polar regions. For hydrogen, whose molecule consists of two atoms, inhibited molecule formation at the surfaces of regolith particles can be an additional mechanism of retention of the implanted atoms. Inhibited degassing overcompensates the lack of solar wind flux at high latitudes. This is consistent with the enrichment of the lunar polar regions in hydrogen observed by Lunar Prospector. A similar global distribution can be expected for the other solar-wind-implanted elements, in particular, for 3He that is a potential thermonuclear fuel. Thus, polar regions may be the most promising sites for extraction of 3He, as well as the other gases.}

A bubble is a plasma volume of typically spherical shape, which is separated from the ambient plasma by a negatively biased grid of high transparency. Ions and electrons from the ambient plasma flow into the bubble volume. In steady state the flow of particles and currents is divergence-free, which is established by the plasma potential inside the bubble. The grid has two sheaths, one facing the ambient plasma, the other the bubble plasma. The inner sheath is observed to become unstable, causing the plasma potential in the bubble to oscillate. The instability arises from an excess of ions and a deficiency of electrons. Its frequency is in the range of the ion plasma frequency but depends on all parameters which influence the charge density in the sheath. When the grid voltage is very negative, electrons cannot enter the outer sheath, and the inner sheath becomes a virtual anode which reflects ions such that the bubble interior is empty. When an electron source is placed into the bubble it can neutralize the ions and the bubble refills. Without plasma sources or sinks the bubble plasma is extremely sensitive to perturbations by probes. Modified current-voltage characteristics of Langmuir and emissive probes are demonstrated. A sequence of papers first describes the basic steady-state properties, then the time evolution of bubbles, the effects of electron sources in bubbles, and the role of the grid and bubble geometry. The physics of plasma bubbles is important to several fields of basic plasma physics such as sheaths, sheath instabilities, diagnostic probes, electrostatic confinement, and current and space charge neutralization of beams.},

We identify major trends that govern the sputtering anisotropies and provide a semi-empirical dependence, which describes the energy distributions and the average energies of atoms emitted under oblique ion impact. This dependence replaces the well-known Thompson formula in cases when anisotropies are important.}

Although there is hardly a paper on plasma-sheath modeling that does not quote the Bohm criterion, Bohm's paper and his results are widely misunderstood. The reason for this is that, in his paper, Bohm himself misinterpreted his result by concluding that the sheath edge coincides with the reference point of his plasma-sheath model. As a result, the criterion for the reference point obtained by Bohm to ensure monotonicity of his sheath solution (i.e., the Bohm criterion) was erroneously applied to the sheath edge and was used in literature as a criterion for sheath formation. In this paper, we show that the Bohm criterion when applied to the sheath edge contradicts Bohm's own definition of the sheath and cannot be obtained from Bohm's plasma-sheath model.},

A limitation of the surface potential due to ion field emission was observed for the surface field intensity of 3 \textbackslash times 10\^8 V/m, which is a considerably lower value than expected. The density of the discharging current was as high as \textsuperscript{-5\$} A/m2, and increased exponentially with increasing intensity of the electric field. As there are no data of the ion field emission from insulators, we have used the zinc grains for a comparison. Taking into account the irregular shape of used metallic grains, we conclude that the ion field emission from the glass grains starts at a significantly (two orders of magnitude) lower electric field intensity than that from metals. This may lead to the limitation of the attainable surface potential of small insulator grains. The possible effect of the ion field emission on the charging of dust grains in the interplanetary space is discussed.}

Measurements verify that the absorption occurs within the Doppler-broadened resonance location where ||\o mega \textendash{} \o mega\_ce|| {$<$} k\textbackslash par vte and B{$<$} 950{$\pm$}25 G. A ray tracing calculation is used to model power deposition in the ECR source region. Plasma radial uniformity improves when the microwaves are allowed to propagate several wavelengths ({$>$} 5) before absorption occurs. An explanation for this improved source uniformity is the fact that whistler waves refract toward regions of lower density which, when combined with ECR absorption at the low-density location, forces the profile toward radial uniformity. This effect explains previous observations of flat density profiles in configurations where the magnetic field at the microwave window is raised well above the resonant field. Etch rate uniformity is found to be closely correlated to the ion current density uniformity across the wafer surface in our system.},

The rotational temperatures remain in both cases close to room temperature. The conversion efficiency, expressed as a critical plasma power to reach almost complete depletion, is four times higher in the argon case. This is explained by the lower threshold for the generation of energetic particles (electrons or metastables) in argon as the main reactive collision partner, promoting excitation and dissociation of CO2, by the less efficient quenching of vibrational excited states of CO and CO2 by argon compared to helium and by a possible contribution of more energetic electrons in an argon plasma compared to helium.},

Helium, hydrogen, neon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and argon were investigated on tungsten, platinum-blackened-tungsten, platinum, and aluminum surfaces which were contaminated to an undetermined degree with oxides and adsorbed gases. A thermal beam of gas molecules was directed against the test surface at normal incidence, and momentum transfer measurements were obtained with the surface at various temperatures over the range 25\textdegree{} to 550\textdegree{} C. The experimental results indicate that the efficiency of the momentum transfer process increases with the molecular weight of the test gas and the roughness of the test surface, but is relatively independent of the substrate material under the present conditions. The momentum transfer rates for helium and hydrogen are significantly less than those measured for the heavier gases at the same surface temperature. The accommodation of the test gases to the surface temperature appears to be incomplete except, possibly, for argon and carbon dioxide. The results cannot be explained successfully by means of the classical model which assumes that the re-emitted gas consists of two components, one experiencing specular reflection and the other complete accommodation at the surface. A modified model and a corresponding momentum accommodation coefficient are introduced and employed in the discussion of the experimental data.},

The modeling of the gas and particle flow field for different nozzle geometries and process parameters in correlation with the results of the experiments reveal that adhesion only occurs when the powder particles exceed a critical impact velocity that is specific to the spray material. For spherical copper powder with low oxygen content, the critical velocity was determined to be about 570 m/s. With nitrogen as the process gas and particle grain sizes from 5-25 {$\mu$}m, deposition efficiencies of more than 70\% were achieved. The cold sprayed coatings show negligible porosity and oxygen contents comparable to the initial powder feedstock. Therefore, properties such as the electrical conductivity at room temperature correspond to those of the bulk material. The methods presented here can also be applied to develop strategies for cold spraying of other materials such as zinc, stainless steel, or nickel-based super-alloys.}

According to the definitions of accommodation coefficients, a proper statistical algorithm in non-equilibrium molecular dynamics method was described and verified. In planar Poiseuille gas flow in a smooth microchannel, the TMAC were calculated considering both the effects of temperature and gas\textendash wall interaction. In the simulation processes, more gas molecules began to be adsorbed near walls under the condition of stronger gas\textendash wall interaction and lower temperature. The gas adsorption resulted in a longer gas\textendash wall interaction time so that the TMAC increased. While the gas\textendash wall interaction became much stronger, more and more gas molecules were adsorbed to form an explicit layer above the wall. The full coverage of gas molecules on the wall prevented further adsorption; therefore the TMAC did not keep on increasing as the interaction strength continued to increase. Meanwhile, the normal momentum accommodation coefficient (NMAC) was also calculated according to the definition. In the isothermal flow, the average gas momentum normal to the wall was in complete accommodation with the wall, and the NMAC was almost unity in smooth micro channels.},

The first is called PBgun and is a commercially available ray tracing code; the second, called simulation d'extraction de faisceaux d'ions (SEFI) uses a particle-in-cell code to simulate the plasma and ion beam. It is the purpose of this article to ascertain whether these codes can adequately model the plasma/beam interface and hence successfully predict the extracted current and beam form across a broad range of extraction parameters. We found that SEFI could accurately predict the function of extracted current versus extraction voltage and that PBgun gave accurate simulations when the current or current density could be specified near the meniscus. Also for a thin plasma aperture and a fixed current at the meniscus, PBgun gave roughly 60\% of the functional dependence of the extracted current on the extraction voltage and the other 40\% on variations in the plasma pre-sheath. Both codes had some error from beam crossing near the axis which changed the amount of meniscus curvature predicted. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.}

Nevertheless, due to the complexity of the applications, these trends also show the need for a comprehensive characterization of such plasmas for a deeper understanding of the observed effects. One of the diagnostic methods for experimental determination of key parameters which affect the reactivity of a plasma, i.e., electron temperature, electron density and heavy particle temperature, is laser scattering. In this work, an approach based on a simple and compact laser scattering setup is proposed, which allows an estimation of the above parameters without any additional changes in the acquisition settings. Thus, the experimental effort and possible sources of error can be reduced. The proposed setup is tested experimentally with a commercially available pulsed plasma system, and the results are compared to available data. From this comparison, it is found that the plasma parameters estimated with the proposed scattering setup are plausible.},

By this method the time evolution of the angular distribution can be followed from quartz crystal coverages in the submonolayer regime to depositions corresponding to many monolayers.}

Near the surface of the wall, ions are spontaneously accelerated by a sheath and deliver their momentum and energy to the wall, while most of the electrons are reflected there. The momentum flux of the ions is a vector field, i.e., having both the radial and axial components even if the azimuthal components are neglected in a cylindrical system. Here the spatially- and vector-resolved measurement of the momentum flux near the cylindrical source wall of a magnetic nozzle radiofrequency (rf) plasma thruster configuration is successfully demonstrated by using a momentum vector measurement instrument. The results experimentally identify the spatial profile of a non-negligible axial momentum flux to the wall, while the radially accelerated ions seem to be responsible for the energy loss to the wall. The spatial profiles of the radial and axial momentum fluxes and the energy lost to the wall are significantly affected by the magnetic field strength. The results contribute to understand how and where the momentum and energy in the artificial plasma devices are lost, in addition to the presently tested thruster.},

For consistency, the ion flux energy distribution function is referred to as the ion energy distribution function (IEDf) even though it more accurately represents the one-dimensional ion velocity distribution function. In the past, these devices have operated at voltages less than 1 kV. Higher operating voltages ({$>$}2 kV) are currently desired. For an RFEA to operate at these voltages, design changes are necessary that impact the energy resolution and cause space charge build-up. To investigate the effect the design changes have for a high voltage RFEA, electromagnetic simulations and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations were used to analyze the electric field between the grids, the potential drop in the grid holes, and space charge build-up between the grids. Non-unique optimized dimensions for the RFEA increased the electric field uniformity. The optimization minimizes the electric field from distorting the IV curve or adversely affecting the energy resolution. It was found that a larger grid gap distance and smaller grid hole diameter decreases the potential drop in the grid holes improving energy resolution. IV curves from the PIC simulation were used to obtain space charge distorted IEDfs. The point at which space charge distorts the IV curve is dependent on the grid gap distance and incoming flux. Space charge build-up was found to only affect low energy ions which manifested by cutting off the low energy portion of the IEDf. To fix space charge distortions, the flux into the probe can be limited or it may be possible to account for the distortion when calculating the IEDf.},

The dissolution study was carried out in a flat surface type gas\textendash liquid reaction chamber utilizing a gas flow-pattern resembling plasma jets which are often used in biomedical applications. The concentration of NO and NO2 in the gas mixtures was varied in a broad range by oxidizing up to 800~ppm of nitric oxide in Ar carrier gas with variable amount of ozone. The production of nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) in the water was proportional to treatment time up to 50~min. The concentration of NO3- was a power function of gas phase NO2 while the concentration of NO2- increased approximately linearly with gas phase NO2. The formation of NO2- and NO3- could be described by reactions between dissolved NO2 and NO in the water while the production rate was determined by diffusion-limited mass transport of nitrogen oxides to the bulk of the liquid. At higher NO2 concentrations, the formation of dinitrogen tetraoxide (N2O4) increased the formation rate of NO2- and NO3-. The identified mass transport limitation by diffusion suggests that convection of water created by the gas jet is insufficient and dissolution of nitrogen oxides can be increased by additional mixing. In respect of practical applications, the ratio of NO2- /NO3- in water could be varied from 0.8 to 5.3 with treatment time and gas phase NO2 and NO concentrations.},

Furthermore, it is found that the classical scaling of D-2 (the gap spacing D) for the CL current density remains exactly valid, while the scaling of V3/2 (the applied gap voltage V) can be a good approximation for low applied gap voltage and for low dust charge density.}

Its comprehensive experimental characterization is therefore very expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, in designing broad-beam ion sources, support using a computer simulation appears highly useful. In our flexible approach to this problem we employ the commercial IGUN code to calculate the properties of a single beamlet in dependence on various plasma and grid parameters. Then, superposition of all the beamlets at target position yields the broad-beam profile. The plasma parameters are chosen so as to adjust the calculated ion beam current to the corresponding measuring value. This procedure is applied to the broad-beam ion source ISQ 76 with standard grid system. Calculated and experimentally determined broad-beam profiles show a quite satisfying agreement between each other.}

The dissociated atomic neutral oxygen density is highest in O\_2/Xe mixtures and lowest in O\_2/He mixtures, increases with electron density, and decreases with electron temperature. Estimates of the dominant source and sink rates of atomic oxygen are used to explain these results using a simple zero-dimensional dissociation kinetics and transport model.

We find that the electron temperature is weakly dependent on the rf power, and thus the electron density can be controlled using the rf power. The electron temperature and density are also modeled and measured in mixtures of two noble gas species. We find that the electron temperature can be controlled by altering the composition of the noble gas mixture. Thus modulation of noble gas admixture ratios and rf power allows the electron density and temperature to be controlled independently. This independent control is shown to maintained with the addition of up to 20\% partial pressure of oxygen, suggesting binary noble gas admixtures may provide additional control of dissociation kinetics.}

Where the outer shell of the system is excited the state will normally decay with emission of optical photons that may be detected with conventional spectroscopy. Where there are vacancies in the inner shells the species may be detected by subsequent emission of Auger electrons or x-rays. The review provides a comprehensive catalogue of the available data and attempts to correlate the various observations. Optical emissions from sputtered and recoil particles are strongly influenced by radiationless de-excitation processes and this is incorporated into models that describe both line shape and line intensity. There is, however, no well developed description of how the excited states are formed. Thermal excitation models that describe excitation in terms of a Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium plasma are shown to be poorly founded. Alternative models ascribing excitation to bi-particle collision events have not yet been quantitatively tested. Inner shell excitation certainly appears to be governed by electron promotion events in the transient quasi-molecule formed by a projectile and target atom. We review briefly the possible applications of ion induced optical emission to the analysis of surface composition.}

The 110, 110 and 121 directions of ejection were chosen for the experiments. Bombardment was with either 43 kev A+ ions, 43 kev Xe+ ions or 66 kev Xe+ ions. The energies of the ejected atoms ranged from some \textsuperscript{-2\$} ev up to about \textsuperscript{-2\$}, though there were significant deviations from this, particularly for 100 ejection. A theoretical model is developed in which ejection results principally from the generation of atomic collision cascades by the bombarding ion. The assumptions that energy in the cascades is shared by two-body collisions and that the mean collision free path is independent of energy lead to an \textsuperscript{-2\$} spectrum and this prediction should hold roughly from \$10\$ to \$10\^3\$ ev. It is shown that the consequence of surface binding of atoms, with a binding energy \$E\_b\$, is a refraction of atomic trajectories and a peak in the spectrum near \$E = E\_b\$. This random cascade model is unable to explain all features of the spectra, particularly the sharp peaks that appear when they are plotted as time-of-flight spectra. But a more advanced model, which allows for the generation of focused collision sequences by the cascade, fits the data extremely well. This allows for both types of sequence, assisted and simple, and represents their separate characteristics realistically. Deviations from the predictions of the advanced model are confined to energies below 1 ev, where thermal spikes are thought to contribute, and above 103 ev. where the collision free path is probably enhanced by channelling and the normal decrease in cross section with energy. At room temperature the discrepancy only amounts to about 10\% of the total sputtering yield. The random cascade and focused collision sequences contribute roughly equal amounts. From a comparison of the predicted and observed spectra it can be deduced, firstly, that for simple focused collision sequences travelling along the 110 rows the maximum energy of propagation is \$167 \textbackslash pm 25\$ ev and their maximum range is at least 21 collisions; secondly, that for 110 assisted sequences the energy limit is \$500 \textbackslash pm 100\$ ev and the maximum range is about 23 collisions: thirdly, that the effective binding energy to the gold surface in these experiments varied from 2.5 to 4.1 ev. An interatomic potential for Au is deduced, consistent with the observed 110 focusing energy and the bulk modulus of elasticity. In the Born-Mayer form, \$A \textbackslash exp(-r/b)\$, the constants are \$A = 200 \textbackslash pm 60\$ kev and \$b = 2.88 / (14.3 \textbackslash pm 0.4)\$ \AA, valid from 1.4 to 2.88 \AA.}

Three differences were noted: (1) at low argon pressures a broad zone 1-zone 2 transition zone consisting of densely packed fibrous grains was identified; (2) zone 2 columnar grains tended to be faceted at elevated temperatures, although facets were often replaced by smooth flat surfaces at higher temperatures; (3) zone 3 equiaxed grains were generally not observed at the deposition conditions investigated.

Heating flux measurements at typical substrate locations surrounding cylindrical-post magnetron sputtering sources were made for the argon sputtering of seventeen metals, representing a range of atomic masses, crystallographic structures and sputtering yields. The heating flux data are combined with deposition rate measurements and are reported as energy per coating atom deposited. They are consistently interpreted in terms of four basic heating processes: (1) heat of condensation; (2) sputtered atom kinetic energy; (3) plasma radiation; (4) ion neutralization and reflection at the cathode. Ion reflection becomes increasingly important for the high mass materials. The energy per atom deposited is independent of the deposition rate and the argon pressure and varies from 15 to 25 eV atom-1 for light metals to over 50 eV atom- for heavy metals with moderate sputtering yields. The sputtering efficiency is shown to be a useful concept in accounting for ion reflection. Comparative data are reported for sputtering with nitrogen and oxygen and for cylindrical-hollow magnetron sources. The energy per atom is relatively high in nitrogen and oxygen sputtering because of a high sputtering efficiency and a reduced metal sputtering yield. The closer proximity of the plasma in hollow cathodes introduces a plasma bombardment contribution to the heating flux.}

The wavelength difference is chosen to create a 25 \textmu m long periodic beating interferometric pattern allowing a nanometer precise position measurement but limited to within an ambiguity range of 25 \textmu m . The ambiguity is then eliminated by scanning one of the wavelengths over a small range (3.4 nm). We measured absolute distances in the sub-meter range and this with just few nanometer repeatability.}

A part of this paper is devoted to introducing the Langmuir probe technique, especially with regard to its application under conditions when collisions between the charged and neutral particles in the probe sheath cannot be neglected and when the electron energy distribution function in plasma cannot be approximated by a Maxwellian one. In the experimental part we present Langmuir probe measurement of low-pressure and atmospheric-pressure plasma jet systems that are currently used for experiments with deposition of materials with special properties. Most of the experimental results presented in this paper are original data.

The electronic stopping power is assumed to be due to a momentum transfer during scattering of the target atom's electrons in the screened Coulomb field of the projectile and vice versa. The Coulomb repulsion between the nuclei of colliding particles is shown to decrease greatly the electronic stopping in the limiting case of small, reduced energies, E{$<<$}1. This leads to inelastic energy losses being no longer linearly dependent on the particle velocity, as predicted by the linear-response theory. The latter effect explains the experimentally observed strong dependence of the kinetic electron emission well below the threshold on the energy of ions bombarding a solid surface. At relatively large energies (E{$>$}1) the expression obtained reduces to the result found earlier by Lindhard and Scharff [Phys. Rev. 124, 128 (1961)]. The total energy losses of slow atoms calculated on the basis of the formula derived for the inelastic stopping power and the expression for the elastic energy losses available in the literature are in good agreement with the experimental data.}

Additional "intermediate" conditions follow from the requirement that spatial derivatives of the ion velocities are finite everywhere within the plasma volume. The amount of such independent conditions is sufficient to determine, in an iterative way, also the position in the plasma where they have to be imposed.

However, to-date, there have been no reports on the direct measurement of the localized, transient thermal response of a material surface exposed to a plasma. Here, we use time-resolved optical thermometry in-situ to show that the energy flux from a pulsed plasma serves to both heat and transiently cool the material surface. To identify potential mechanisms for this `plasma cooling,' we employ time-resolved plasma diagnostics to correlate the photon and charged particle flux with the thermal response of the material.

In stable or weakly unstable regimes DAWs can be excited externally. The experimental data is critically compared with fluid and kinetic models. It is found that a kinetic model is capable of describing the observed DAW dispersion while the standard fluid model fails. The high growth rate ensures that the instability reaches high wave amplitudes despite the small dimensions of the dust region.},

Two novel thruster concepts are proposed which differ both from electrospray-like colloid thrusters and nano field-emission thrusters, which extract nanoparticles from suspensions. It is shown that particle charging in a plasma is not sufficient for electrostatic acceleration. Moreover, it appears technically difficult to extract charged particles out of a plasma for subsequent acceleration without being discharged. It is proposed to charge particles with low secondary electron emission using an energetic electron beam, e.g. with graphite particles surface potentials of \$-90\$ V can be obtained. Another promising concept is charging by contact with needle electrodes at high electrostatic potential (\$\textbackslash sim\$ 20 kV), which allows for maximum possible specific charges.}

Since its first introduction it has been controversial for theoretical reasons and due to the lack of experimental data, in particular on the ion distribution function. Here we resolve the theoretical as well as the experimental difficulties by an exact solution of the kinetic Boltzmann equation including charge exchange collisions and ionization. This also allows for the first time non-invasive measurement of spatially resolved ion velocity distributions, absolute values of the ion and electron densities, temperatures, and mean energies as well as the electric field and the plasma potential in the entire plasma. The non-invasive access to the spatially resolved distribution functions of electrons and ions is applied to the problem of the kinetic Bohm criterion. Theoretically a so far missing term in the criterion is derived and shown to be of key importance. With the new term the validity of the kinetic criterion at high collisionality and its agreement with the fluid picture are restored. All findings are supported by experimental data, theory and a numerical model with excellent agreement throughout.},

The ion kinetics is governed by the ionization of neutrals at electron impacts. The plasma consisting of Boltzmann distributed electrons and singly charged ions is in contact with the absorbing negative wall. The derivations are performed in the frame of the ``asymptotic two-scale'' approximation, when the ionization mean-free path Li is much larger than the electron Debye length \$\textbackslash lambda\_D\$. In the limit \$\textbackslash lambda\_D/L\_i \textbackslash arrow 0\$, the plasma-wall transition (PWT) layer can be split into two sublayers: a quasineutral presheath (PS) (with the scale-length Li) and the Debye sheath (DS) (with the scale ?D). Such a subdivision of the PWT layer allows to investigate these sublayers separately and simplify the analysis of the influence of the ion source thermal motion (this has been neglected in the major part of publications up to now). The uniform description of the PWT layer as a single unit is complicated by the singular presheath and sheath structure and by a coupling with the eigenvalue problem originating from the plasma balance in the bounded system. The issue is clarified both analytically and numerically by construction of a matched asymptotic expressions. The equation and the length-scale governing the transition between neighboring PS and DS sublayers are derived. The eigenvalue problem combining the wall potential, the wall location, and the ionization mean-free path is discussed.}

  abstract = {Qualitative analysis of two new effects related to the influence of a strong magnetic field on the state of complex dusty plasmas is given. First, it is shown that the dust shape asymmetry, together with the presence of plasma charging flux, creates an angular momentum flux on a dust grain causing its rotation. The value of the estimated angular velocity is compared with that already observed. The magnetic moment related to the balance of the angular momenta transfer by plasma flux and the friction on neutrals is estimated. It is estimated that the interactions of these magnetic moments are usually much weaker than the Coulomb interactions. Apart from the magnetic moments induced by plasma flux the dust grain can have an intrinsic magnetic moment. Both of them create an average magnetization in complex plasmas. Second, it is shown that an increase in an external magnetic field first decreases the dust charges (when the electrons in the charging process start to be magnetized) and then, with a further increase of the magnetic field, the dust charges increase (when the ions in the charging process start to be magnetized). Only the limiting cases of strong electron and ion magnetization are discussed.}

The direction of the angular momentum and the direction of the grain rotation axis is determined by the vector product [u \textbackslash cross n], where n is a unit vector directed from one hemisphere with \textbackslash kappa\_+ to another hemisphere with \textbackslash kappa\_-. The angle \th eta between n and u determines the range of impact parameters and the range of impact angles of ions which reaches either one or the other grain hemisphere. This gives an analytical algebraic equation for the range of angles of the impact parameters of ions in the plane perpendicular to the flow which determines the transfer of the angular momentum. The solution of this equation and integration with respect to the impact parameters is obtained numerically. The angular momentum transfer is proportional to (\textbackslash kappa\_+ - \textbackslash kappa\_-)2u\^2a\^2misin(\th eta)F(\th eta,z), where z=2Zde2/amiu2 is the dust dimensionless charge, a is the dust radius, and mi the ion mass. The function F(\th eta,z) is found numerically and for z=2 is approximately equal to F=1+0.24sin\^8(\th eta). With the decrease of z, the absolute value of F (reached at sin(\th eta)=1) gradually decreases and for z=0.1 it is equal to 0.001. The terms with larger power of sin2(\th eta) are prevailing at smaller values of the dust charges. The solution of the equation for the dust rotation was found by taking into account the angular momentum transfer in charging, the friction in neutral gas, and the dust angular momentum inertia. It is shown that in general, after switching on the ion flow, the dust rotates several times until it is aligned to the ion flow (vectors n a- nd u being antiparallel). The number of rotations depends on the the ratio of the friction force to the angular momentum inertia force. The effect of the grain alignment to the ion flow can be used both for the nonmagnetic and ferromagnetic dust grains. The ferromagnetic dust grains can be used to create magnetic fields by dust in absence of external magnetic fields. Continuous dust rotation can be excited by a modulated ion flow.}

The description is based on the radially inhomogeneous kinetic treatment of electrons, ions and excited atoms in the plasma and includes the self-consistent determination of the radial space-charge field and the axial heating field. The determination of the axial field becomes possible by the additional consideration of the most important plasma-wall interaction processes and a balance of the electron surface density on the dielectric tube wall. The results of the description are compared with those of Langmuir probe measurements which makes conclusions about the properties of the plasma-wall interaction processes possible. It is shown that the wall processes and, hence, the wall properties are of great importance for the establishment of the electric field and the kinetic structure of the plasma components in the column.}

Since the beams can be used to locally alter material at the point where they are incident on a surface, they represent direct nanofabrication tools. The authors will focus here on direct fabrication rather than lithography, which is indirect in that it uses the intermediary of resist. In the case of both ions and electrons, material addition or removal can be achieved using precursor gases. In addition ions can also alter material by sputtering (milling), by damage, or by implantation. Many material removal and deposition processes employing precursor gases have been developed for numerous practical applications, such as mask repair, circuit restructuring and repair, and sample sectioning. The authors will also discuss structures that are made for research purposes or for demonstration of the processing capabilities. In many cases the minimum dimensions at which these processes can be realized are considerably larger than the beam diameters. The atomic level mechanisms responsible for the precursor gas activation have not been studied in detail in many cases. The authors will review the state of the art and level of understanding of direct ion and electron beam fabrication and point out some of the unsolved problems.},

In general, the external circuit equations provide a mixture of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions for the Poisson equation, which is solved each time step for the internal plasma potential. We rewrite the coupling between the plasma and the external circuit parameters as an algebraic or ordinary differential equation for the potential on the boundary. This scheme allows decomposition of the field solve into a Laplace solver with boundary conditions (e.g., applied potentials) and a Poisson solver with zero boundary conditions. We present the details of the external circuit coupling to an explicit electrostatic planar two-dimensional particle-in-cell code called PDP2, and discuss briefly how the coupling can be done in an implicit electrostatic code. The decomposition replaces the iterative coupling with a direct coupling and reduces the amount of computational time spent in the field solver. We use PDP2 to simulate a dually excited capacitively coupled RF discharge and show how such a system can be used as a plasma processing tool with separate control over ion flux and ion bombarding energy.}

A two-dimensional capacitive radio-frequency (rf) discharge is investigated in detail. Simple frequency scaling laws for predicting the behavior of some plasma parameters are derived and then compared with simulation results, finding good agreements. It is found that as the drive frequency increases, the sheath width decreases, and the bulk plasma becomes more uniform, leading to a reduction of the ion angular spread at the target and an improvement of ion dose uniformity at the driven electrode.}

  abstract = {The space charge density in low-pressure discharges results from the generation of charged particles, the momentum transfer from these particles to the neutral gas and the electric field. A simplified model is used to treat this process analytically and numerically across the whole plasma. The effect of the electric field alone can cause the formation of the space charge sheath if the ion drift velocity v\_i to the wall exceeds the modified Bohm velocity v\_C = v\_B \textbackslash times (ni/ne)1/2, where v\_B is the Bohm velocity and ni and ne are the number densities of the ions and the electrons, respectively. However, a domain with v\_i \textbackslash geq v\_C can occur only if the effect of collisions is weak. This domain is very narrow and does not come up to the wall. Limits of the electric field strength determining the sheath formation are given. It is shown that the electric field strength cannot be set equal to zero at v\_i = v\_B or v\_C under collisional conditions. The sheath extends from the region near the wall towards the centre and a result of that is to lower v\_i with respect to v\_B as the collisionality rises. These results are used to take into consideration various sheath criteria. The Bohm criterion takes into account the effect of the electric field only and reveals a well-defined sheath edge at v\_i = v\_B. This criterion remains a useful approximation of the sheath edge in almost collisionless plasmas as well. Under collisional conditions the definition of the sheath edge becomes more difficult and a little arbitrary. This paper takes into account new sheath criteria modified for the case of finite collisionality. The divergence between the densities of the ions and the electrons, the gradients of the space charge density and of the generalized Bohm speed v\_C are studied as functions of v\_i or the distance from the wall. These criteria are compared with the collisionally modified Bohm criteria proposed by Godyak (1982 Phys. Lett. A 89 80), Valentini (1996 Phys. Plasmas 3 1459), Chen (1998 Phys. Plasmas 5 804) and Brinkmann},

The saturation vapour pressure is the pressure at which water vapour is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed state. At pressures higher than vapour pressure, water would condense, whilst at lower pressures it would evaporate or sublimate.  The saturation vapour pressure of water increases with increasing temperature and can be determined with the Clausius\textendash Clapeyron relation. The boiling point of water is the temperature at which the saturated vapour pressure equals the ambient pressure.  Calculations of the (saturation) vapour pressure of water is commonly used in meteorology. The temperature-vapour pressure relation inversely describes the relation between the boiling point of water and the pressure. This is relevant to both pressure cooking and cooking at high altitude. An understanding of vapour pressure is also relevant in explaining high altitude breathing and cavitation.},

It is shown that the accuracy requirements are quite severe for lower voltage impacts, up to about three times Vmax (where Vmax is the voltage at which the normal secondary emission ratio reaches its maximum value, \textbackslash delta\_max), but are less stringent above this range. A new formula for the low-voltage region, which agrees with experimental data better than the formula of R.G. Lye and A.J. Dekker (1957), is proposed. For the voltage region above 4 Vmax, the Lye and Dekker formula is retained, with a smooth transition centered between 3 and 4 Vmax. The directional effect is modeled by adjusting the values of \textbackslash delta\_max and Vmax before applying either formula, rather than applying either Bruining's or Muller's correction factor afterward. This results in an automatic modeling of the known absence of any appreciable directional effect below about half Vmax. Some experimental verification of the formula used to modify \textbackslash delta\_max is presented}

Previous modeling studies considering diffusive effects also could reasonably reproduce and explain the experimental results for a large set of experimental parameters like temperature, flux and sample concentration.

Thus, the main focus of the present study is directed towards the elucidation of this fluence mismatch. Comparison of one and two-dimensional simulation results reveal a strong dependency of the tungsten enrichment on the sample homogeneity and a significantly delayed reduction of the erosion yield due to a pronounced formation of surface structures from initially flat sample surfaces.},

For the single crystals, Young's modulus was found to decrease linearly with increasing temperature from 100\textdegree C. to the highest temperature of measurement. For all the polycrystalline materials, except silicon carbide, stabilized zirconium oxide, and spinel, Young's modulus was found to decrease approximately linearly with increasing temperature until some temperature range characteristic of the material was reached in which Young's modulus decreased very rapidly and in a nonlinear manner with increasing temperature. This rapid decrease at high temperature is attributed to grain-boundary slip. Stabilized zirconium oxide and spinel were found to have the same rapid decrease in Young's modulus at high temperature, but they also had a decidedly nonlinear temperature dependence at low temperature.},

Langmuir probe measurements are taken in the near-field plasma surrounding a nude Faraday probe, which is located 1 m from the exit plane of the University of Michigan/U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory P5 Hall thruster. The thruster is operated at an anode flow rate of 5.30 mg/s, at backpressures of 1.5\texttimes 10\^-3 Pa (1.1\texttimes 10\^-5 torr) and 4.8\texttimes 10\^-4 Pa (3.6\texttimes 10\^-6 torr), corrected for xenon. The effect of the facility backpressure is clearly seen in the wings of the plume. A combination of charge-exchange collisions and vacuum chamber gas ingestion into the thruster is believed to be the cause of this phenomenon. The Langmuir probe results indicate that the electric fields near the nude Faraday probe are functions of facility backpressure and the angle from the thruster centerline. The plasma potential measured within 20 mm of the probe varied by no more than 3 V. Thus, the electric fields near the nude Faraday probe are not large enough to explain the increased collection of charge-exchange ions at elevated facility background pressures and large angles from the thruster centerline.}

  abstract = {Cold atmospheric pressure helium plasma jets are increasingly used in many processing applications, due to a distinct combination of their inherent plasma stability with excellent reaction chemistry often enhanced downstream. Despite their widespread usage, it remains largely unknown whether cold atmospheric plasma jets maintain similar characteristics from breakdown to arcing or whether they possess different operating modes. In addition to their known ability to produce a fast moving train of discrete luminous clusters along the jet length, commonly known as plasma bullets, this paper reports evidence of two additional modes of operation, namely a chaotic mode and a continuous mode in an atmospheric helium plasma jet. Through detailed electrical and optical characterization, it is shown that immediately following breakdown the plasma jet operates in a deterministic chaotic mode. With increasing input power, the discharge becomes periodic and the jet plasma is found to produce at least one strong plasma bullet every cycle of the applied voltage. Further increase in input power eventually leads to the continuous mode in which excited species are seen to remain within the inter-electrode space throughout the entire cycle of the applied voltage. Transition from the chaotic, through the bullet, to the continuous modes is abrupt and distinct, with each mode having a unique set of operating characteristics. For the bullet mode, direct evidence is presented to demonstrate that the evolution of the plasma jet involves a repeated sequence of generation, collapse and regeneration of the plasma head occurring at locations progressively towards the instantaneous cathode. These offer previously unavailable insight into plasma jet formation mechanisms and the potential of matching plasma jet modes to specific needs of a given processing application.},

Analysis of the measurements reveals interesting correlations between the induced charge-exchange plasma environment and thruster operating conditions. Sensors near the thruster exit measured charge-exchange ions with a number density of \textsuperscript{-3\$} and a current density of \textsuperscript{-7\$} A/cm\textsuperscript{-2\$} under typical thruster operating conditions, a result in good agreement with preflight predictions based on computer particle simulations.

Lofted large aggregates and surface mobilization are related to many space observations. We experimentally show that the emission and re-absorption of photoelectron and/or secondary electron at the walls of microcavities formed between neighboring dust particles below the surface are responsible for generating unexpectedly large negative charges and intense particle-particle repulsive forces to mobilize and lift off dust particles.},

  abstract = {Sputtering has been studied under well controlled conditions, i.e., low gas pressure (1 micron), defined energy (up to 300 ev) and angle of incidence of the bombarding ions, and high ion-current density (10 ma/cm2), by immersing the target in a low-pressure Hg plasma of high density created in a pool-type vacuum arc. It turned out that threshold energies (minimum ion energy for sputtering to ensue) are considerably lower under oblique than under normal incidence, and the atoms are ejected away from the direction of incidence. Thresholds were measured for twenty-three metals under normal incident Hg-ion bombardment. They follow, without exception a simple law: The product of the momentum transferred at threshold from ion to target surface atom and the sound velocity of the target material is proportional to the heat of sublimation of the target material. The threshold energies to be expected accordingly in the case of rare gas ion bombardment under normal incidence are tabulated. The yield (atoms per ion) vs ion energy was carefully measured for the case of polycrystalline Pt. When metal single crystals were sputtered, it was discovered that atoms are preferentially ejected in the directions of closest packing, that is [110] in fcc, [111] in bcc and diamond lattice. Deposits sputtered from plane low-index surfaces of single crystals therefore form characteristic patterns. Their study reveals more details: At low ion energy, only such atoms are sputtered which have no obstructing neighbors in the way of a close-packed direction. At higher ion energy, additional atoms are set free from positions where neighbor atoms interfere. Such atoms deviate in a characteristic way from the directions of close packing. Most atoms sputtered in close-packed directions which are parallel to the surface are trapped again, causing growth of oriented hillocks. The possibility for crystal growth by sputtering was demonstrated in another experiment. Some characteristic features of the etch effects caused by sputtering are described. The basic process in sputtering at low ion energies is one of momentum transfer. The important parameters with respect to the gas discharge are ion energy, angle of incidence, and atomic weight of ion; on the target side they are the atomic weight, the elastic constants, crystal structure and orientation, the heat of sublimation, dislocations, and surface roughness. Many details need durther clarification, and the studies are being continued.}

The collisions in the presheath are modeled by a relaxation time approximation (namely, Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model, or simply BGK model). To find the variation in electrostatic potential with position, the model and analysis from Emmert et al. (1980), are used. Distribution functions of the ions and electrons in a collisionless presheath and sheath on a wall partially reflecting ions and electrons, therefore, can be exactly obtained. The reflections of the ions and electrons by a wall play important roles in studying heat transfer from a plasma sheath to a workpiece surface, and sputter etching and deposition, ion implantation, and ion scattering spectroscopy. Irrespective of ion and electron reflectivities, velocities of the ions in the presheath and sheath are of highly non-Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. The electrons in the presheath are close to Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, whereas those in the sheath are non-Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Even though the wall partially reflects ions and electrons, the Bohm's criterion is marginally satisfied at the sheath edge. The computed distribution functions for a completely absorbing surface agree with theoretical results provided in the literature. Good comparison of the resulted transport variables with available analytical work is presented in the companion paper.}

The results find that dimensionless transport variables of ions and electrons in the presheath and sheath can be exactly expressed in terms of transcendental functions determined by dimensionless independent parameters of ion and electron reflectivities of the wall, ion-to-electron mass ratio, charge number, and electron-to-ion temperature ratio at the presheath edge.

The results for the total thermal power at the substrate are compared with values published by other groups for similar discharge systems. The contributions of different kinds of particles are discussed. For the dc discharge at a discharge power of 50 W and a pressure of 0.8 Pa, a thermal power of 15.6 mWcm-2 has been found which is mainly produced by particles other than the plasma ions. It can be concluded from the increase of the thermal power with decreasing pressure that bombardment by particles originating from the target is the main source of the substrate heating. In an rf discharge the ion energy is two times and the flux density is nearly three times higher than in a dc discharge.

A MFMI with the variable-range provides an efficient and economy way to study the exhaust plume of both electric and chemical thrusters. The flexural pivots, replaceable strain gauge, replaceable target plate, and force arm with the variable length make it possible. The designed MFMI with the non-displacement measurement can reduce the influence of pipelines and test lines, especially the elastic force and friction due to displacement. The designed MFMI system with the range of 0\textendash 100 mN and 0\textendash 15 N was calibrated separately. The target indirect measurement method is a simple and economical option for measuring the thrust of electric thrusters, and is employed to measure the thrust of the LIPS-200 ion thruster using the designed MFMI. Research indicates that the sputtering contributes to the momentum transfer of plasma-surface interactions. In addition, the high-speed charged ions from the thruster will experience a charge-exchange (CEX) collision with the slow neutral background. Therefore, the influence of the sputtering and CEX on target indirect measurement method is derived in detail, and then the measured thrust is corrected. The measured average thrust, which is 40.1 mN, demonstrates that the designed MFMI is effective. The designed MFMI can also be employed as a thrust stand by directly mounting the thrusters on torsional arm, and a maximum of three thrusters can be installed on the MFMI at the same time.},

Organisms have evolved hierarchical branching networks that terminate in size-invariant units, such as capillaries, leaves, mitochondria, and oxidase molecules. Natural selection has tended to maximize both metabolic capacity, by maximizing the scaling of exchange surface areas, and internal efficiency, by minimizing the scaling of transport distances and times. These design principles are independent of detailed dynamics and explicit models and should apply to virtually all organisms.},

  abstract = {A high sensitivity momentum flux measuring instrument based on a compound pendulum has been developed for use with electric propulsion devices and radio frequency driven plasmas. A laser displacement system, which builds upon techniques used by the materials science community for surface stress measurements, is used to measure with high sensitivity the displacement of a target plate placed in a plasma thruster exhaust. The instrument has been installed inside a vacuum chamber and calibrated via two different methods and is able to measure forces in the range of 0.02\textendash 0.5 mN with a resolution of 15 N. Measurements have been made of the force produced from the cold gas flow and with a discharge ignited using argon propellant. The plasma is generated using a Helicon Double Layer Thruster prototype. The instrument target is placed about 1 mean free path for ion-neutral charge exchange collisions downstream of the thruster exit. At this position, the plasma consists of a low density ion beam 10\% and a much larger downstream component 90\%. The results are in good agreement with those determined from the plasma parameters measured with diagnostic probes. Measurements at various flow rates show that variations in ion beam velocity and plasma density and the resulting momentum flux can be measured with this instrument. The instrument target is a simple, low cost device, and since the laser displacement system used is located outside the vacuum chamber, the measurement technique is free from radio frequency interference and thermal effects. It could be used to measure the thrust in the exhaust of other electric propulsion devices and the momentum flux of ion beams formed by expanding plasmas or fusion experiments.}

It identifies the various interactions between the plasma and the catalyst that can modify and activate the catalytic surface and also describes how the catalyst affects the properties of the discharge. Techniques for in situ diagnostics of species adsorbed onto the surface and present in the gas-phase over a range of timescales are described. The effect of temperature on plasma\textendash catalysis can assist in determining differences between thermal catalysis and plasma-activated catalysis and focuses on the meaning of temperature in a system involving non-equilibrium plasma. It can also help to develop an understanding of the gas-phase and surface mechanism of the plasma\textendash catalysis at a molecular level. Our current state of knowledge and ignorance is highlighted and future directions suggested.},

  abstract = {The structure and connectivity of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been deduced from reconstructions of electron micrographs of serial sections. The hermaphrodite nervous system has a total complement of 302 neurons, which are arranged in an essentially invariant structure. Neurons with similar morphologies and connectivities have been grouped together into classes; there are 118 such classes. Neurons have simple morphologies with few, if any, branches. Processes from neurons run in defined positions within bundles of parallel processes, synaptic connections being made en passant. Process bundles are arranged longitudinally and circumferentially and are often adjacent to ridges of hypodermis. Neurons are generally highly locally connected, making synaptic connections with many of their neighbours. Muscle cells have arms that run out to process bundles containing motoneuron axons. Here they receive their synaptic input in defined regions along the surface of the bundles, where motoneuron axons reside. Most of the morphologically identifiable synaptic connections in a typical animal are described. These consist of about 5000 chemical synapses, 2000 neuromuscular junctions and 600 gap junctions.}

Depending on the operation conditions the plasma in these sources may be highly ionized, which completely changes its transport properties. The most striking difference to weakly ionized plasma is that diffusion will become intrinsically ambipolar. We further discuss means of plasma diagnostics. As noninvasive diagnostic methods we will discuss analysis of the ion beam, optical spectroscopy, and measurement of the x-ray bremsstrahlung continuum. From beam analysis and optical spectroscopy one may deduce ion densities, and electron densities and distribution functions as a mean over the line of sight along the axis (optical spectroscopy) or at the plasma edge (ion beam). From x-ray spectra one obtains information about the population of highly energetic electrons and the energy transfer from the driving electromagnetic waves to the plasma\textendash basic data for plasma modeling.}

The capacitively coupled plasma source is the predecessor of the known COST reference jet with identical performance and it is operated in a diffuse mode with gas temperature close to the room temperature. Threshold ionisation molecular beam mass spectrometry is used to measure absolute densities of CO, O               2               , O and O               3               species. The CO molecules are generated with densities up to 2~\texttimes ~10               15               cm               -3               at 1 W absorbed power. The O               2               density is {$\sim$}6 times lower than the CO density and even lower than the O density at level of 4.5~\texttimes ~10               14               cm               -3               .

The high O density could indicate that the vibrational excitation of CO               2               is ineffective in this plasma and gas mixture, because O would otherwise react quickly with vibrationally excited CO               2               (v) to form CO and O               2               , the low energy efficiency is in agreement with the possibly low vibrational excitation.

This paper shows that these errors can be reduced to less than 10\% by using more realistic interatomic potentials. We have calculated interatomic potentials from first principles in the free-electron approximation for 14 diatomic interactions representing light particles incident on heavy targets (M1 {$<<$} M2), self-irradiation (M1 = M2), and heavy particles on light targets (M1 {$>>$} M2). The potentials were approximated by a Moli\`ere-like form and the parameters tabulated for general covenience. The classical orbit equation was integrated numerically for bare potentials and the scattering cross section, stopping power, range, and straggling calculated. Simple three-parameter expressions for the stopping power are given which are directly integrable to obtain the range. The results are in reasonable agreement with experiment for a representative Kr-C potential and agree within 10\% for an average potential derived from the free-electron calculations.}

  abstract = {Cold plasmas operating under atmospheric conditions have been in the focus of scientific attention not only due to their use in plasma medicine. Many of these plasma sources most notably produce ozone. This work presents a detailed ozone analysis on an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet operated in ambient air using ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy. A special focus is placed on the question whether other species are involved, or is the absorption signal due to ozone. For this, the wavelength dependence of the optical depth was measured and compared with the theoretical optical depth including the cross section of ozone. The results show that in the case of a MHz frequency driven atmospheric-pressure argon plasma jet the absorption signal in the UV range is solely due to ozone. Furthermore, this finding is verified by spectroscopic measurements in the IR spectral range. Additional space-resolved ozone density measurements are performed in the effluent of this jet with small oxygen admixtures by means of UV absorption spectroscopy. A funnel-shaped spatial ozone profile is found for all investigated oxygen admixtures. The highest ozone density develops on the effluent axis and in close vicinity to the jet nozzle. The maximal detected value is 1.5 \texttimes{} 1016 cm-3 for an oxygen admixture of 1\%. In order to compare the results with non-space-resolved ozone detection methods the ozone net production rate is calculated.},

The surrounding atmosphere of the jet is varied from pure oxygen to pure nitrogen with a gas shielding device. The highest metastable density of 1.3 \texttimes{} 1013 cm-3 is obtained in the center of the jet close to the nozzle exit at normal atmospheric air conditions. Within 0.3 mm in the radial direction and 2 mm in the axial direction, the He metastable density drops below the detection limit. The obtained He metastable lifetime is almost independent of the shielding gas composition. By analyzing the diffusion of shielding gas species into the effluent it is concluded that their density is too low to explain the observed He metastable lifetime. Instead, impurities from the feed gas, especially water molecules, are more likely to be responsible. However, a drastic change in metastable He density is observed when decreasing the amount of oxygen in the shielding gas. The lower the oxygen amount, the lower the metastable He density. For pure nitrogen, no He metastables are detected at all. By exchanging nitrogen with argon, a similar behavior is observed. Thus, it is concluded that it is the absence of ambient oxygen rather than the elevated presence of nitrogen, which is responsible for the observed decrease in the He (23S1) density.},

  abstract = {The SRIM simulation code, developed for calculating the stopping and range of ions in matter, was evaluated with the aim of determining its reliability for predicting sputtering yields of solids and ranges of low-energy ions. The simulations were performed using two recent versions, SRIM-2000 and -2003. Irrespective of the choice of the three input parameters of the code (the surface binding, the bulk binding, and the displacement energy), the sputtering yields at a fixed impact energy were found to exhibit an unusual Z1 dependence, which is strongly at variance with experimental results as well as with the predictions of analytical sputtering theory (Z1 and Z2 are the atomic numbers of projectile and target atoms, respectively). As shown in detail for targets of silicon and substantiated for titanium, the ratios of calculated to experimental or analytical yields are generally (much) too large for Z1/Z2{$<$}0.7, decrease rapidly around Z1/Z2=1, and are too small for Z1/Z2{$>$}2 (high-to-low ratios differing by a factor of 3.4 at 1 keV). Additional calculations of the projectile isotope effect in sputtering suggest that the sputtering-yield artifact of SRIM is buried in an incorrect approximation to projectile-target scattering. The low-energy electronic stopping powers of SRIM-2003 were found to be much too low. Differences between detailed and quick calculation modes were also identified. Additional problems are caused by the assumed nonrandom target-atom spacing. The use of SRIM in its present form for calculating sputtering yields and low-energy ranges cannot be recommended. As a by-product of this study it was found by analysis of published experimental data as well as by simulations that, at energies below about 5?keV, the projected ranges of heavy ions in light element targets such as silicon increase with increasing projectile mass, a previously unknown effect.}

A substrate dummy which is thermally isolated and inserted into the plasma at substrate position served as thermal probe which can be moved in vertical and horizontal directions in order to measure the different energy fluxes and their distribution in the reactor vessel. The knowledge of the spatial distribution is important, for example, for coating or sputtering processes. Different contributions to the total energy flux are identified by different orientations of the thermal probe, e.g., if the probe is facing the RF electrode the energy flux is much higher than in the opposite direction. This difference can be addressed to an additional energetic contribution due to secondary electron emission from the powered RF electrode.},

  abstract = {Laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine the velocity distribution of sputtered neutral, ground state U atoms produced by bombardment of the metal target by normally incident 1 to 3 keV Kr {$\div$} and Ar +. The data were obtained using a pulsed Nd-Yag pumped tunable dye laser. Determination of the o-perpendicular (velocity component of the sputtered atom perpendicular to the target surface) velocity distribution was accomplished by scanning the wavelength of the exciting laser (the laser beam was normal to the target surface) through the Doppler shifted absorption frequencies of the sputtered U atoms. In order to interpret the observed velocity distributions it was found that one has to pay careful attention to tEe details of the laser induced fluorescence process itself and to the geometry of the optical system used to excite and detect the fluorescent emission. It was determined in the present work that it is essential to know the transition rates associated with the atomic levels involved in the fluorescent excitation and emission process, the laser intensity and bandwidth, the spatial dimensions of the ion beam on the target, and the fluorescent excitation and emission regions as defined by the exciting laser beam and the light collection optics. Neglect of these parameters could lead one to conclude erroneously that sputtered atoms with "negative" velocities are moving back towards the target surface. It is shown that by taking account of power broadening of the atomic lineshape function, which depends upon the exciting laser intensity, one obtains velocity distribulins in excellent ageement with the number density analog of the Sigmund-Thompson model for a linear collision cascade flux density velocity distribution: n(u) do : [u2 /(o 2 + vg)n+ l ]dv, n(v) is the number density velocity distribution, u b is a velocity which corresponds to the assumed planar surface binding energy of the target; and n is a parameter, generally 1 {$<$} n {$<$} 2. The present results indicate that n = 1.85 -+ 0.15 with u b = 2.09 X 105 cm/s (which corresponds to the sublimation energy of solid uranium, E b = 5.4 eV). These parameters were found to be independent of the incident ion (Kr {$\div$} or At*) and of the incident ion energy over the range 1-3 keV.},

The eigenvalue equation was first derived analytically by using the expansion theorem and then the eigenvalues and eigenvectors were calculated numerically. In comparison with the general finite element method (FEM), the ANC method has the advantage that there is no necessity to derive the property matrices of each beam element and then to develop the overall ones of the entire beam. In comparison with the transfer matrix method (TMM) the ANC method requires no tedious matrix multiplication so that some computer time may be saved. The ANC method is also better than the pure analytical (closed form) method, since, instead of a few special cases, a uniform beam carrying any number of point masses of various magnitudes or distributions along the beam length can be easily solved. Besides, by using the ANC method, there is no difficulty in taking more modes in the mode superposition equation and hence more higher mode natural frequencies of better accuracy may be obtained.}

Far away from the Sun, at around 3 AU, the activity of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is low and changes with local time (solar insolation), with location (chemical heterogeneity of the surface), and with season. When the activity is very low because the total cross section of the comet against the Sun is small, the solar wind has access to the surface of the comet and causes ion-induced sputtering of surface material, which we wish to observe. Methods. We used the Double Focussing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS) of the ROSINA experiment on ESA's Rosetta mission to search for mass spectrometric evidence of sputtered refractory species. In high-resolution mode, DFMS can separate some of the mass peaks of refractory elements from the many volatile species present in the coma. Results. At present, the locations of solar wind surface access are in the southern hemisphere of the comet (the local winter). Of particular interest is sputtering of dust grains on the surface. We observe global averages over the winter hemisphere of the refractory elements Na, K, Si, and Ca, presumably sputtered from grains residing on the surface. Compared to carbonaceous chondrites, the comet has the same Na abundance, is depleted in Ca, and has an excess of K. In addition, for Si the signal strength is strong enough to compile a coarse compositional map of the southern hemisphere. Most, perhaps all, of the observed variation can be explained by the solar wind being affected by the atmosphere of the comet.},

The fluid equations of electrons and ions, including the time derivative terms, are solved numerically to follow the temporal evolution of the plasma and sheath.

The R\textendash T curve measured from the film surface is very different from that measured from the substrate back surface. With the increase of temperature, the former exhibits the transition from almost temperature-independent region to semiconducting region whereas the latter shows a decrease of resistance. The transition temperature increases with increasing film thickness. The composite shows the temperature-independent feature below the transition temperature and the semiconducting feature over the transition temperature. Furthermore, for the R\textendash T curve measured from the substrate back surface, the resistance of the composite is smaller than that of the HCl-PANI. With the increase of film thickness, it decreases and trends to be stable.

The former effects means that the recoil flux keeps the memory of the incident ion-beam direction because of the incomplete cascade, while the latter one means the contributions of recoils generated at the deeper layer to the angular and the energy distributions of sputtered atoms. The anisotropic effect is important in the low energy region, and it makes the angular distribution under-cosine and the high energy tail of the energy distribution fall off faster than the Thompson distribution. The bulk recoil effect makes angular distribution be over-cosine and the peak position of the energy distribution be shifted to somewhat higher energies.},

The same approach is successfully applied to analysis of the angular distribution of sputtered atoms. The formula obtained is shown to predict well the heart-shaped angular distribution for normal incidence. In order to explain the non-linear effect of sputtering yields in heavy-ion bombardment on high Z material, a shock wave model is applied. The present approach has shown that the sputtering yield is nearly proportional to \$S\_n\^\textbackslash frac32\$, not to S\_n(E) , where S\_n(E) is the nuclear stopping cross section. The non-linear Monte Carlo simulation is also performed in order to investigate the difference between linear cascade and non-linear cascade.}

However, due to the nature and the environment of these spraying processes, the feedstock powder structure and properties suffer from decomposition, which subsequently degrade the performance of the coatings produced. The cold gas dynamic spraying process appears to be a promising alternative technique to preserve the properties of the feedstock powder during the coating preparation. Although the latter technique can minimize or eliminate the degradation of the sprayed material, the deposition of cermet using this technique is a difficult task. In this study, two types of cermet powders, the nanocrystalline (WC\textendash 15Co) and the conventional (WC\textendash 10Co4Cr) powders were deposited using the cold gas dynamic spraying and the pulsed gas dynamic spraying processes. The feedstock powders and coatings microstructures were investigated by OM, SEM and XRD, as well as their hardness. The results revealed the possibility of depositing cermet coatings onto aluminum substrates using both processes without any degradation of the carbide phase of the feedstock powder. The cold gas dynamic spraying process experienced difficulty in depositing and building up dense coatings without major defects. The pulsed gas dynamic process produced thick cermet (conventional and nanocrystalline) coatings with low porosity as long as the feedstock powder was preheated above 573 K.}

In this work, the plasma is composed of a collisionless presheath and sheath on an electrically negative biased surface that partially reflects or secondly emits ions and electrons. The presheath is an ionization region that continuously produces ions to maintain ion loss to the workpiece, while the sheath is a space-charge region that accelerates ions and retards electrons to the negative biased surface. The predicted total momentum flux at the wall including that of the ions and electrons as a function of negative electrically biased voltage is found to agree well with experimental data.

  abstract = {The ion energy distribution of a capacitively coupled r.f. (13.56 MHz) plasma and ion beam source has been measured. The extraction optics consists of two stainless steel grids. The source has been operated in two different configurations, either with or without extraction optics. In the latter case the discharge serves only as a plasma source to be used directly or as remote plasma. For measurements of ion energy in the plasma mode a four-grid retarding field analyser (RFA) was used. For analysis of ion energy in the ion beam mode a slightly different RFA was used, because the retarding voltage here is higher, corresponding to extraction voltages of several hundred volts. In the plasma mode, all distributions exhibit a single-peak structure with a low-energy tail. With increasing pressure from 4 z t0 -2 to 4 Pa the distribution width shows an increase from 1.5 to 4.5 eV, whereas the average ion energy decreases from 48 to 17.4 eV. In the ion beam mode, the ion energy distribution is studied as a function of the r.f. power and pressure.},

Geometric analyses show that the stability of corner contour evolution, which is determined by the ion incident angle only, has a significant effect on the erosion rate of exit edge and the contour evolution of channel wall corner while the initial right-angle of channel wall corner cannot be kept intact under non-uniform ion bombardment. The similarity between simulation and experimental results indicates that the corner contour evolution stability is likely to be one of the major causes for the formation of corner eroded contour which has a significant effect on the edge erosion rate of the Hall thruster channel wall.},

The method is based on drift time measurements via the delay time between arc current modulation and ion flux modulation. A correlation has been found between the element-specific ion velocity and average ion charge state; however, differently charged ions of the same element have approximately the same velocity. These findings contradict the potential hump model but are in agreement with a gasdynamic model that describes ion acceleration as driven by pressure gradients and electron-ion friction. The differences between elements can be explained by the element-specific power density of the cathode spot plasma which in turn determines the temperature, average charge state, and ion velocity of the expanding vacuum arc plasma.}

Under most discharge conditions, the particles are found to be expelled from the central plasma region. A transition to a situation where the falling particles are focused into the plasma center is observed at low gas pressures using small particles. These investigations allow a quantitative understanding of the mechanism of unwanted dust-free areas (so-called voids) in dusty plasmas under microgravity. Good quantitative agreement with standard models of the ion drag is found.}

The volume fraction of porosity decreased with a decrease in the distance between the nozzle and the substrate. Furthermore, a decrease in average particle size led to a reduction in porosity of the deposited material.

Their precise structural and compositional characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the WC and Cr3C2 layers were amorphous, while the TiC layer had a polycrystalline structure. The ion sputtering rates of all three carbides, amorphous carbon and polycrystalline Cr, Ti and W layers were determined by means of Auger electron spectroscopy depth profiling as a function of the angle of incidence of two symmetrically inclined 1 keV Ar+ ion beams in the range between 22\textdegree{} and 82\textdegree. The sputtering rates were calculated from the known thicknesses of the layers and the sputtering times necessary to remove the individual layers. It was found that the sputtering rates of carbides, C-graphite and metals were strongly angle dependent. For the carbides in the range between 36\textdegree{} and 62\textdegree{} the highest ion sputtering rate was found for Cr3C2 and the lowest for TiC, while the values of the sputtering rates for WC were intermediate. The normalized sputtering yields calculated from the experimentally obtained data for all three carbides followed the trend of theoretical results obtained by calculation of the transport of ions in solids by the SRIM code. The sputtering yields are also presented in terms of atoms/ion. Our experimental data for two ion incidence angles of 22\textdegree{} and 49\textdegree{} and reported values of other authors for C-graphite and metals are mainly inside the estimated error of about {$\pm$}20\%. The influence of the ion-induced surface topography on the measured sputtering yields was estimated from the atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements at the intermediate points of the corresponding layers on the crater walls formed during depth profiling.}

  abstract = {We characterize the performance of a modular broad beam ion source by energy resolved mass spectrometry and beam profile measurements. Using the same source housing and grid system, we performed our experiments powering the source with a hot filament or an ECR excitation, respectively. In the ion energy distribution we detect various peak structures reflecting the potential profile across the ion source as well as different charge exchange and dissociation processes occurring in the beam. The position of these peaks on the energy scale allows conclusions to be formed about the original charge state of the ion, when produced by charge exchange, or on the original molecule, when produced by dissociation. The most important contribution to the ion beam is caused by process gas ions with important impurities from source materials appearing with reactive process gases. Using electronegative gases, a large amount of negative ions generated in the beam is observed. The performance of both excitation types due to the beam parameters is very similar. A comparable power supplied to the source plasma delivers similar beam currents and profiles. The resulting beam current is determined by the density and the potential structure in the source plasma. The axial potential gradient in the plasma, and with it the resulting beam current, is strongly affected by the total voltage applied between the grids and can be derived from the shape of the main peak in the ion energy distribution. The detected radial beam profile is determined simultaneously by the ion optical parameters of the grid system and the space charge potential in the beam. For a fixed grid geometry the shape of the plasma sheath at the screen grid is an important factor controlling the source performance. The shape of the plasma sheath is simultaneously controlled by the voltage difference between the grids and the Debye length. Changes in the shape can be derived from the ion energy distribution with the experimental results being in good agreement with numerical beam simulations. The only important difference between both excitation types is that using the Kaufman type excitation the potential of the source plasma is exactly fixed by the beam potential, whereas with the ECR source it deviates by several tens of volts depending on microwave power and process gas.},

The ratio between mean ion energy and mean sheath thickness reflects the effect of collisions on the ion energy distributions and enables estimates of sheath thickness and bulk plasma parameters to be made which are compared with values obtained by Langmuir probemeasurements.

Numerical simulation of the free-jet expansion from six types of nozzles indicated that the flow fields had significant differences in the early stages of the expansion.

This article can therefore include only the most prominent theoretical and experimental features of closed drift thrusters. In some regards, this article is also an attempted synthesis of the differing views of these thrusters found in literature, as well as in our own work. In a closed drift thruster, the electric field that accelerates the ions is established by an electron current that passes through and is impeded by a magnetic field. The precessing electrons in this magnetic field follow a closed drift path giving this thruster its name. Closed drift thrusters are divided into magnetic layer and anode layer types, based both on the geometrical and material differences in the discharge channels of the two types, and on the different physical processes that take place within the discharge plasma. Considered as a whole, the publications on closed drift thrusters constitute an impressive body of information that, for the most part, was generated in Russia independently of US research on electric thrusters.},

  abstract = {SRIM is a software package concerning the stopping and range of ions in matter. Since its introduction in 1985, major upgrades are made about every five years. For SRIM-2003, the following major improvements were made: (1) About 2200 new experimental stopping powers were added to the database, increasing it to over 25,000 stopping values. (2) Improved corrections were made for the stopping of ions in compounds. (3) New heavy ion stopping calculations have led to significant improvements on SRIM stopping accuracy. (4) A self-contained SRIM module has been included to allow SRIM stopping and range values to be controlled and read by other software applications. A full catalog of stopping power plots has been published at www.SRIM.org. Over 500 plots show the accuracy of the stopping and ranges produced by SRIM along with 25,000 experimental data points. References to the citations which reported the experimental data are included.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for the preliminary design of Low-Thrust, many-revolution transfers. The main feature of the novel approach is a considerable reduction in the control parameters and a consequent gain in computational speed. Each spiral is built by using a predefined pattern for thrust direction and switching structure. The pattern is then optimised to minimise propellant consumption and transfer time. The variation of the orbital elements due to the thrust is computed analytically from a first-order solution of the perturbed Keplerian motion. The proposed approach allows for a realistic estimation of \$\textbackslash Delta V\$ and time of flight required to transfer a spacecraft between two arbitrary orbits. Eccentricity and plane changes are both accounted for. The novel approach is applied here to the design of missions for the removal of space debris by means of an Ion Beam Shepherd Spacecraft. In particular, two slightly different variants of the proposed low-thrust control model are used for the different phases of the mission. Thanks to their low computational cost they can be included in a multiobjective optimisation problem in which the sequence and timing of the removal of five pieces of debris are optimised to minimise propellant consumption and mission duration.},
