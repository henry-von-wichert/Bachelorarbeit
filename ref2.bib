  abstract = {In this work, a self-consistent model has been used to estimate the effective secondary electron emission coefficient ({$\gamma$}E) of the cathode in typical abnormal dc glow discharge conditions. Using this model, the value of {$\gamma$}E has been obtained for tungsten (W), copper (Cu), and stainless steel (SS304) cathode samples for argon (Ar) and nitrogen (N2) discharges. The {$\gamma$}E for W is lower than the Cu cathode under identical operating conditions. The results show possible dependence of {$\gamma$}E on the Fermi energy of the cathode material since it influences the probability of electron to be emitted by the incident ion. In addition to this, we found, significant contribution of cathode directed species other than ion to {$\gamma$}E. Further, the effect of pressure on {$\gamma$}E for the N2 discharge has been investigated in the pressure range of 0.5 mbar to 2.0 mbar and its value increases from 0.38 to 0.47 with pressure for the SS304 cathode. The knowledge of {$\gamma$}E successfully explains the governing processes in abnormal glow discharge plasma that cannot be explained by the value of the ion induced secondary electron emission coefficient {$\gamma$}i. The measurement of the {$\gamma$}E value of the cathode material in typical abnormal glow discharge plasma conditions presents possibilities of exciting advancement in various applications by accurate estimation of discharge characteristics including flux of species, fraction of power carried by ions and electrons, plasma density, discharge current density, etc.},

  abstract = {Dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) are plasmas generated in configurations with an insulating (dielectric) material between the electrodes which is responsible for a self-pulsing operation. DBDs are a typical example of nonthermal atmospheric or normal pressure gas discharges. Initially used for the generation of ozone, they have opened up many other fields of application. Therefore DBDs are a relevant tool in current plasma technology as well as an object for fundamental studies. Another motivation for further research is the fact that so-called partial discharges in insulated high voltage systems are special types of DBDs. The breakdown processes, the formation of structures, and the role of surface processes are currently under investigation. This review is intended to give an update to the already existing literature on DBDs considering the research and development within the last two decades. The main principles and different modes of discharge generation are summarized. A collection of known as well as special electrode configurations and reactor designs will be presented. This shall demonstrate the different and broad possibilities, but also the similarities and common aspects of devices for different fields of applications explored within the last years. The main part is devoted to the progress on the investigation of different aspects of breakdown and plasma formation with the focus on single filaments or microdischarges. This includes a summary of the current knowledge on the electrical characterization of filamentary DBDs. In particular, the recent new insights on the elementary volume and surface memory mechanisms in these discharges will be discussed. An outlook for the forthcoming challenges on research and development will be given.},

  abstract = {This review summarizes the state of the art of plasma diagnostics on atmospheric pressure plasmas formed at characteristic length scales of approximately 1 mm or smaller and identifies challenges and prospects. Both plasmas generated in confined geometries, so-called microplasmas, as well as discharge filaments occurring in commonly filamentary plasmas, e.g. microdischarges in dielectric barrier discharges are covered. In spite of the differences between microplasmas which often obtain a quasi steady-state and single microdischarges or filaments which are self-limited in space and time and thus intrinsically transient, both face very similar diagnostic challenges of which two are immediately apparent: the high collisionality which requires adaptations of standard plasmas diagnostics often developed for low-pressure plasmas, and the requirements on high spatial resolution due to the strong gradients in plasma properties. The complexity of the plasma generation and the physical and chemical properties of the above-mentioned plasmas requires the knowledge of an extensive series of different parameters to obtain a full characterization. As the results of the diagnostics are not always unambiguous and require a detailed understanding of plasma physics and chemistry, a summary of the main properties and pecularities of high-pressure plasmas is included in this review.},

Research on atmospheric pressure non-equilibrium plasmas intensified over the last two decades leading to a large variety of plasma sources that have been developed for an extended application range including chemical conversion, medicine, chemical analysis and disinfection. The fundamental understanding of these discharges is emerging but there remain a lot of unexplained phenomena in these intrinsically complex plasmas. The properties of non-equilibrium plasmas at atmospheric pressure span over a huge range of electron densities as well as heavy particle and electron temperatures.

The chapter also discusses other breakdown phenomena, such as coronas and the hollow electrode carrier generation used in pseudosparks. Electrical breakdown occurs in a gas when a high-conductivity channel is formed between cathode and anode. Before a study is made of the behavior of gases under the influence of an electric field, it is appropriate to review the basic principles of the kinetic theory of gases pertinent to gaseous ionization and breakdown. From there, the various concepts of ionic and electronic can be inferred. The chapter further discusses the efficient use of gaseous insulation with intershields. It concludes by discussing the important aspects of breakdown behavior in gaseous SF6.},

The candles are burned under controlled laboratory conditions to measure the mass burning rate, candle regression rate, flame height, and heat flux. Using the properties of paraffin wax and characteristics of the candles, numerous simulations are performed with the NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) to model the burning rate and heat flux profile of the candle flame. The modeling results are then compared with the flame height and heat flux data obtained experimentally. The model facilitates an enhanced understanding of the structure of candle flames.},

Sheath thicknesses in the range of a few {$\mu$}m have been calculated by the collision-dominated Child\textendash Langmuir law and trends are confirmed by the optical imaging. Energy flux measurements revealed a pronounced effect of ions on the measurement process and resulted in high energy fluxes locally up to 275 W cm-2.

To optimize these applications and possibly improve them, one has to understand plasma\textendash surface interaction. This study will emphasize the energy flux as a key parameter in plasma\textendash surface interaction. The technique of passive thermal probes (PTPs) as a suitable diagnostic to measure the energy flux is described and discussed. With such probes, the heating and cooling of a ``substrate dummy'' with a well-defined surface is measured. From the obtained temperature as a function of time, the integral energy flux can be deduced. This integral energy flux consists of various contributions, e.g., chemical contributions such as recombination or oxidation and kinetic energy of plasma species such as impinging ions, electrons, and neutrals. Beginning with a historical overview, this work aims to present the technique of the PTP in its entirety. This includes an explanation of the design along with different calibration and evaluation methods. Exemplary experimental results will be provided to emphasize its versatility and significance as diagnostic for modern atmospheric pressure plasma research.},

This energy flux serves to heat the surface out of thermal equilibrium with bulk material, thus enabling local physicochemical processes that can be harnessed for material manipulation. However, to-date, there have been no reports on the direct measurement of the localized, transient thermal response of a material surface exposed to a plasma. Here, we use time-resolved optical thermometry in-situ to show that the energy flux from a pulsed plasma serves to both heat and transiently cool the material surface. To identify potential mechanisms for this `plasma cooling,' we employ time-resolved plasma diagnostics to correlate the photon and charged particle flux with the thermal response of the material. The results indicate photon-stimulated desorption of adsorbates from the surface is the most likely mechanism responsible for this plasma cooling.},
